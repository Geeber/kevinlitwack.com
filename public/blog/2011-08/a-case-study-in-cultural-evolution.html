Perhaps it's not super on-topic for
   this blog, but it's very much on my mind, so I figured I'd give a quick view of Burning Man from
   a memetic perspective.</p><p class="paragraph">When we talk about a "culture" what we usually mean, in broad terms, is a large memeplex that
   guides the behavior and interactions of a group of people. Like all memeplexes, cultures compete
   with each other and evolve over time. Various elements of a cultural memeplex will gradually
   mutate, as new ideas are either generated internally or copied over from rival cultures.
   Occasionally whole cultures will die off, unable to spread themselves in the face of the changing
   memescape (globalization has arguably caused several such extinctions). Once in a while a more or
   less totally new culture arises, cobbled together from random bits and pieces of its antecedant
   environment. The Burning Man culture may well represent such a phenomenon.</p><p class="paragraph">There are quite a few places around the web that can tell you about the history and nature of
   the event. Rather than duplicating that content, here's an e-mail I recently wrote to my Burning
   Man camp (which includes a number of first-timers), entitled "What It Means to Be a Burner":</p><p class="paragraph">To me, being a Burner is fundamentally about working with those around you to make the best
   community possible. But not in a hippie, "let's all hold hands until everyone's happy" kind of
   way.  Burners are some of the most hard-nosed, practical, and sophisticated people I've ever been
   around.  Because holding hands doesn't make the world go around. Hard-working people do, and the
   better they work together, the better the community.</p><p class="paragraph">Just about everything in the culture can be traced, one way or another, to that purpose. A truly
   worthwhile (and very concise) read is the <a href="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html">10 Principles</a>, if you haven't seen them yet. I pretty much agree with all of them, but there are a few in
   particular that stand out to me as major parts of the Burner ethos.</p><p class="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest is gifting. When I talk to "non-burners" about the event, they often say
   things like "Oh, that's the one with no buying and selling, just a barter economy, right?" No,
   Burning Man is not a barter economy. When someone gives you a gift at Burning Man, there is no
   expectation of anything in return. People give because they like giving. If you want to enjoy
   your playa experience, I highly recommend finding ways that you can give to the community.
   Whether it's an awesome costume for people to look at, a cool performing skill, or even just
   really good cooking, giving to each other is a central part of life on the playa.</p><p class="paragraph">After that, my next-favorite is radical self-reliance. This is one that has played a huge role
   in my personal life. Going and spending a week doing everything to survive in one of the world's
   most hostile environments reminds you of something very important: you are the product of
   millions of years of highly selective evolution, and you are insanely badass (paraphrasing Neal
   Stephenson).  Sometimes modern comforts make us forget that, and we settle into listlessness,
   apathy, and cynicism (which never saved the world). So I encourage you to take radical
   self-reliance seriously: on the playa, you should strive to never need help from anyone. Just
   don't worry too much, because everyone needs help sometimes, and when you do the Burning Man
   community will be there for you (a phenomenon often encapsulated by the popular idiom, "the
   playa provides").</p><p class="paragraph">To these I might also add my own observation: Burners are ruthlessly self-improving. Realizing
   your own abilities shows you your potential, and having seen that, it's pretty hard to justify
   stagnation. You can always do more things, and you can always do them better. You want to know
   why Burning Man is still so amazing and "fresh" after all these years? It's because every year
   Burners work their asses off to do even sicker, more ridiculous, more awesome projects than the
   year before.</p><p class="paragraph">Finally, Burners are some of the kindest, most respectful, and most understanding people you
   will ever deal with. Even the most bitter ideological adversaries will happily agree to disagree
   (unless it's the "hot and grumpy" part of the playa afternoon), because at the end of the day
   we're all in this together, and who really knows anyway. Burners will not judge you, although
   they may give you friendly advice ;)</p><p class="paragraph">As you can probably tell from the above, I'm a huge fan of the event and would recommend it to
   anyone as just a fun time and a great experience. But I would <em>especially</em>recommend it to those with an interest in the evolution of culture, because it's so
   fundamentally different from the "mainstream" cultures that I've encountered. It's hard to say
   right now whether this new memetic species will flourish, or have a few choice elements picked
   out and incorporated into the mainstream, or just die off entirely. Whatever happens we should
   pay close attention, because it's one of today's best opportunities to see memetics in action.</p></div><p class="paragraph">30 Aug 2011 | Tags: <a href="/blog/tag/Memetics.html">Memetics</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Burning Man.html">Burning Man</a></p><p class="paragraph pager"><a href="/blog/2011-09/bandwidth-between-brains.html">&laquo; Bandwidth Between Brains</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/">Home Page</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog/2011-08/applied-memetics.html">Applied Memetics&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p></article></div></div></section></div></div><footer id="footer"><div class="footer-bottom"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="copyright col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">Copyright Â© Kevin Litwack, 2014</div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"><a class="up" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up"></span></a></div></div></div></div></footer><script src="/js/prettify.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/lang-clj.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.carouFredSel-6.2.1-packed.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.touchSwipe.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.elevateZoom-3.0.8.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.appear.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.sparkline.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.easypiechart.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.easing.1.3.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.fancybox.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/isotope.pkgd.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.knob.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.stellar.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.selectBox.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.royalslider.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/jquery.tubular.1.0.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/country.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/spin.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/ladda.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/masonry.pkgd.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/morris.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/raphael.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/video.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/pixastic.custom.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/livicons-1.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/layerslider/greensock.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/layerslider/layerslider.transitions.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/layerslider/layerslider.kreaturamedia.jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/revolution/jquery.themepunch.plugins.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/revolution/jquery.themepunch.revolution.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
