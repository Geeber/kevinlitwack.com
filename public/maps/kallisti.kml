		<description><![CDATA[Greetings all!

The time is finally here. We've bought our last supplies, packed up the boat, and are dotting/crossing the last few i's/t's to get ready to leave. Our plan is to depart during the day tomorrow, heading out of Puget Sound to Neah Bay, then west and eventually south for the warmer waters.

We'll probably begin using our SPOT device tonight or tomorrow, so you should start seeing regular mail (via this google group) with our position updates. In addition, sometime in the first few days I'll be trying to send out a message from our SailMail account, just to confirm that it's working OK.

One thing I wanted to mention is, please don't worry or panic if either or both of these communication channels go silent for a while. A lapse in communication does NOT mean that we're in trouble, or even that anything is wrong. By far the most likely explanations are simple equipment failures (out of power, accidental damage, we forgot to use it...). Rest assured that we have many levels of redundancy in our safety plans, and if something is truly endangering us, appropriate rescue authorities will be contacted (and in turn contact our parents). But hopefully, it won't be an issue, as we'd really like to keep updating everyone as we go Smile emoticon

And with that, we're off! Thanks for following us and I look forward to sharing some good stories with you all.

Cheers,
Kevin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been an eventful voyage so far. This is the first time I've really had a chance to sit down and gather my thoughts into writing, so some of the details may be lost, but I'll do my best to describe the past few days.

Aaron got in on Tuesday night (the 15th) as planned. Ted and I had already finished all the shopping, so we went straight to Kallisti to get settled in. A few of my friends swung by that night to get in a final, and to pick up my car (which I'm leaving in their safe-keeping while I'm gone). We did as much packing as we could, and then passed out on board.

We managed to sleep in pretty late, and roused ourselves around 10 am to do the last preparations and get underway. We finished up packing, dropped off the key fob for the marina gate, and cast off. After quick stops at the diesel fuel dock and the pumpout station, we set out onto the Puget Sound around 12:20 pm, heading north.

The winds were pretty decent when we first got out, and we managed to have an hour or two of fun sailing. They even picked up enough that we practiced putting a reef in the main. It wasn.t too long before they subsided to next to nothing, though, and eventually we gave up on sails and switched to the engine. Unfortunately, the winds never really came back, and we motored the whole way to Neah Bay; the upside of this was that we made great time, arriving at Makah Marina around 9 am Thursday (ahead of even my most ambitious predictions).

We took our time getting ourselves ready at Neah Bay. A quick trip to the (surprisingly well-stocked) general store, some lunch at a local burger joint (perhaps .burger hut. would be more accurate, and a final non-rocking bathroom stop later, we were ready to head to sea. Around noon we said goodbye  to land and made our way back out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

As we steadily cruised westward, we started noticing definite sea swells, and gradually building winds. We shut down the engine as we crossed west of Cape Flattery, and put up sails: genoa, main with a reef, and mizzen. The winds were good, coming from the south/southeast and giving us a nice push out offshore. We were making great time, pushing 6.5 knots.

Things started getting rough as the afternoon wore on. By 4:30 or so, Aaron was started to feel pretty sick, and I was fighting to keep off queasiness myself. We sent Aaron down below to try and let him sleep it off, while Ted and I got our first exposure to open ocean conditions.

I would be lying if I said it wasn.t a little scary and trying. The swells were easily 8-10 feet, and as it started to get dark, we were feeling just a little bit overwhelmed and overpowered. Wanting to play it safe, we hove to and reduced sail area by a lot: dropped the mizzen, put a second reef in the main, and furled up the genny to its first reef line. I was still trying to keep seasickness from getting hold of me, so this whole process was an adventure, but we managed.

We covered Thursday night in shifts, Ted and I taking turns as best we would. He handled most of the early part of the night while I napped, and then around 3 I came up and relieved him. We still had a solid south wind, and I was exhausted, so at about 4:30 am I decided to heave-to and wait for morning. We were already a little over 50 miles offshore, and the forecast was for winds to shift west eventually, so I figured we could afford to sit still for a bit.

At Neah Bay, we had the brilliant idea of buying a little kitchen timer, so that we could take 15-20 minute power-naps during our shifts on watch. I put this to good use right away, waking myself up every 20 minutes from 4:30-8:30 Friday morning to do a scan of the horizon for shipping traffic. Wasn.t too much going on (I might have seen one or two ships the whole night), but better safe than sorry.

When Ted got up at 8:30, we pulled out of the heave-to and picked up a west-southwest tack, still fighting a south wind. As the sun shone on our rig, we noticed our first boat damage. For one, our whisker pole had come loose sometime during the night, and was bouncing all over the foredeck. This was very disconcerting, but easy to fix with a quick lashing to the mast. However, the second blow was more daunting: a 1-2 foot tear along the leech of the genoa.

After some debate, we decided there was nothing for it but to furl it up and throw on a backup sail. Only 2 days into the trip, we were glad we'd decided to bring along our staysail as a backup (we had debated leaving it behind to save space). Still not 100% past my queasiness, I managed to steel myself for a trip to the foredeck, rig the staysail, and hoist it up without major incident.

Friday had not started off well, and didn.t get much better. Aaron was still bedridden; his few attempts at getting up to help out were all met with rapid relapse, so he ended up confined to the starboard settee berth all day. This left Ted and I to tend to the boat, tired as we were, and still fighting that pesky south wind. It was around this time that we heard a Coast Guard broadcast on VHF channel 16 issuing a gale warning for the Strait. We decided to play things really cautiously, given our and the boat.s condition, so we continued under a double-reefed main and a staysail through all of Friday evening and overnight, making about 2 knots on a southwest and eventually southeast tack.

This morning (Saturday) our luck finally turned. As the night wore into morning, the winds shifted to the west as forecast, and Aaron managed to get out of bed long enough to help Ted put up some sails while I rested. With the mizzen, a single-reefed main, and the staysail, we've been heading just about due south at 5-6 knots for most of the day, and are finally feeling like we're making progress towards San Francisco.

There have been many other little trials and tribulations along the way, far too many for me to recall (tired as I am to begin with). Learning to move around the boat while it's pitching and rolling with the swells, and heeling under sail, has taken some getting used to. Many of the original storage locations we'd chosen for food and gear turned out to be poor choices, dumping their contents on the ground at the first big wave. But we have generally adapted and improved our methods as we've been going, and I'm feeling pretty good about where we are right now.

If the weather stays favorable, we stand a good chance of making SF in under 10 days, and that would be quite a nice little accomplishment for our first ocean passage. Still a ways left though, so I'm going to close the laptop down and get some shuteye; need to be fresh for my watch tonight.

		<description><![CDATA[After a few rough patches at the beginning of the trip, things are really looking up. Today.s been a great day, but more on that in a minute. Right now, I'm basking in being warm, happy, well-fed, and (relatively) well-rested for the first time since Seattle. Aaron.s feeling better and has been driving for most of the afternoon. The sun.s out and warm, and we just finished a tasty chili and corn dinner. And Dookie (the Green Day album) is playing in the cockpit speakers. It's pretty blissful, especially in contrast to the cold, wet, and frustration of the past few days.

Last night was a bit of a rough night for me. After taking over for Ted at the wheel around 8:00, I started to get hit pretty hard with exhaustion. I think days of not really getting any solid sleep finally caught up with me. I've been finding it difficult to really get deep enough sleep to be restful, amidst all the clashing and creaking of the boat and its stores as we bounce over swells. Around midnight I just couldn.t keep my eyes open, so I hove to and passed out. At about 2 am Ted got up and took over for me, and I moved down to a bunk.

I tried out the earplugs I.d brought, and they actually helped a ton. I managed to get a solid 7 hours. sleep, and for the first time, had some dreams, which means I was making it to REM (don.t think I had been getting that far before). By the time morning rolled around, the weather was beautiful, but we were only making 2-3 knots, still flying our staysail (with the Genoa out of commission since its tear).

Aaron and I took the helm all morning while Ted racked out, and when he got up, we decided to take advantage of the calm and sunny weather to undertake the somewhat daunting task of trying to repair the Genoa. We fired up the engine and Aaron motored us south for the afternoon, while Ted and I spent a few hours taking down the staysail, unfurling and taking down the Genny, and then taping and sewing it. Full credit to Ted for the repairs though; I was just a dead weight to keep the sail from flapping around while he worked.

At around 4:30 we finished the last repairs and hoisted the repaired sail, and so far it seems to be flying great. We.ve been cruising south-southeast in excess of 6 knots for the last couple hours. It feels good to have hit some adversity and (so far) overcome it . that.s exactly what attracted me to this trip in the first place.

If there.s one dark spot on the day, it's that we still haven.t had any luck getting the monitor windvane self-steering working. This is pretty killer; it forces us to have someone on the wheel 24-7, which is quite tiring. We definitely need to get this fixed before the SF-to-Hawaii leg, as that.s a much longer trip, and we'll be down to 2 crew. But for the moment I'm OK with leaving that problem open; I was never expecting things to go perfectly off the bat. I'll take successes where I can get them.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, the -frustrations- -adversities- learning opportunities continue to abound. After yesterday seemed to be going so well, we had quite an eventful night.

After sitting down to write yesterday.s log entry, I went to try and connect to SailMail, to get a weather update and send a quick note to the kallisti-followers list. When I tried to power on the SSB radio, nothing happened. Nada. Seemed like a total equipment failure. All the other electronics on board were working fine, and a quick visual inspection showed no signs of obvious damage. The thing just wouldn.t power on, period. I still don.t know what.s wrong with it. So that was Bad Thing #1 for the night.

No big deal though, it's far from a critical piece of equipment for us, and we can get it looked at in San Francisco. I was due to take an overnight shift, so I got ready for bed while Ted and Aaron handled the boat. I overheard them talking about the winds picking up, and was vaguely aware as they reefed and then double-reefed the mainsail, as well as reefed the newly-repaired Genoa. I trusted they had things in hand, so I racked out.

A couple hours later, I awoke to sounds of trouble on deck. As I was rousing myself back to consciousness, a cry came down for me to come up and help. I threw on my foul weather gear and jumped up, to see the Genoa flapping madly in a howling breeze, its two sheets a tangled mess wrapped inextricably around each other. I got a quick update: apparently during a gust the reef in the Genoa had come loose, and while trying to fix this, both sheets had gotten pulled through their blocks. (Upon reflection this morning, none of us could recall for sure having put stopper knots in the sheets when we re-ran the Genoa yesterday afternoon; we probably forgot. Live and learn I guess.)

Since then, Ted had managed to hook one of the two sheets back in, and cleated it off. But the situation was still ugly: the Genoa was now effectively hove-to, fully unreefed, and with heavy winds there was nothing we could do to get out of it. The obvious first step was to untangle the second sheet, run it, get the Genoa back under our control, and then try to find a way to furl it up. How to do this, though, wasn.t obvious, since the tension of the sail pulling on the sheets made undoing the tangled mass impossible. I wish we'd shot a picture of this knot . it was pretty epic . but I think at the time we were all a little too tired and panicked to think of it.

After some brainstorming, I suggested a plan I.d learned during my classes: tie a rolling hitch to the sheets, above where the tangle was, and then winch it in to release tension at the tangle. We rigged this up, and I'm happy to say, it worked like a charm! It felt like textbook on-your-feet sailboat problem-solving, which was very gratifying. With the sheets untangled, we managed to luff the sail and then furl it up. Crisis averted, I went back to bed to try and get a few z.s before I needed to relieve Aaron.

I was once more woken up by the sound of trouble, around 3:30 am. This time, it came in the form of a loud grinding sound, followed shortly by an angry buzzing. I leapt out of my berth and ran to see what the problem was. It looked like the propeller shaft was being turned by our motion through the water, and this was causing the grinding. That, by itself, wasn.t too concerning, as it had happened a few times already earlier in the trip. Ted looked it up in his engine maintenance book, which had assured us that this is nothing to be worried about. The buzzing was new though, and with all of us still on edge from the earlier events with the Genoa, things suddenly seemed extremely urgent.

My first thought was that we might have been out of oil, so I grabbed a bottle and hastily dumped a couple dollops into the oil tank, just in case. This had no noticeably effect. So my next thought was, .We have stop the boat.. The only sail we had left up was the main, double-reefed already, but with a strong wind blowing it was still pushing us at 3+ knots. I hopped on deck and managed to take it down, which slowed us some but even under just bare poles we were clocked almost 2 knots, and the buzzing continued.

Finally, it dawned on us to look at the ignition key, and we saw that somehow it had gotten turned on. For whatever reason, there is a builtin alarm in the engine, which buzzes if the ignition key is turned on but the engine isn.t started after 20-30 seconds. Apparently, the key had gotten turned without any of us noticing (still no idea how this happened). We turned the key off, and the buzzing stopped.

Exhausted, frazzled, and with no sails up, we decided to all just crash for the night and re-evaluate our situation in the morning. I slept on deck, using our kitchen timer to wake myself every 45 minutes or so and check the horizon for ships. We made it through to sunrise OK, and with the dawn light, things seemed to become less scary and more sane almost instantly. Within a few hours we had the main back up, the staysail re-rigged in place of the Genoa, and were making good time running south again.

With no SSB, we don.t have a good detailed source of weather information, but we've been using VHF NOAA weather broadcasts to get a sense of what to expect. The next couple days are supposed to be light and generally favorable winds, but calling for heavy air Thursday and Friday. So, the adventure continues, I guess.

		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday and today have been pretty calm winds and seas, so we've finally gotten a chance to catch our breath a bit.

Tuesday was spent resting, troubleshooting, and discussing our situation and expectations for the rest of the trip. Once we'd all taken advantage of the calm seas to get a good long sleep in, we gathered round the cockpit and had a very frank discussion about how we were feeling about the trip so far. I can.t speak for Ted and Aaron, but I felt much better just having talked things through.

A big part of the discussion was around making sure we were on the same page regarding what level of problems constitutes enough of an emergency that we would call for help. This is obviously a really tricky subject to talk about, because there are a lot of hypotheticals and lot of emotions. Ultimately, I think we all had pretty similar opinions, just different ways of expressing them so it took time to talk through.

We also had a bit of a post- (mid-?) mortem on how things had gone through the first five days. We had certainly encountered a fair share of problems, setbacks, and concerns. What was especially disconcerting was the incoming rate of problems, which seemed to be high and growing. We coined the term .positive problem jerk. to express the phenomenon (if that doesn.t make sense, look up the meaning of .jerk. in the context of physics and acceleration). Again, this was a case where once we talked things through, the situation wasn.t actually that bad, and I think we all felt better having had the conversation.

Once we were talked out, we went on to trying to tackle some of the problems. One major one was the engine. I mentioned in a previous entry how we'd noticed the propeller spinning due to our motion, and that Ted.s engine maintenance book said this wasn.t a problem. Well, on Monday night, with the winds all but dead, we decided to turn on the motor for a bit to make some miles south, only to discover that it wouldn.t engage in gear. The engine started fine, but when we shifted into forward, nothing happened; the motor.s rotation wasn.t transferring to the prop.

Ted and I spent some time looking at the engine and V-drive (the component that interfaces the motor to the prop). I also remembered a small note from our survey, way back when we were looking into buying the boat, in which the surveyor mentioned there was some .gear backlash. in the V-drive and that this might indicate a possible degradation of the gears. We put some pieces together, and came up with the theory that we had finally worn those gears out, and the engine was now basically disengaged from the propeller; this theory seems to pretty well explain everything we've experienced so far.

This news was both good and bad. It meant that we were without engine propulsion the rest of the way to SF, which (a) limited our ability to make up for lost time if winds were light and we were running late, (b) reduced our agility to deal with emergencies, and (c) meant probably needing to get a tow into port in SF. But at least the engine itself was sound, and we could still run it to recharge batteries, meaning we didn.t have to start rationing our power consumption. So all in all, frustrating but not a huge deal.

Then I took a look at the SSB. After a quick read through the owner.s manual, I.d gathered that there were two troubleshooting steps for the symptom we had (the unit not powering on). Step 1 was to check the fuses, so I pulled the box open (hooray tinkering with thousand dollar electronics!) and looked, but no luck, they were all fine. The second suggestion was to verify the power cabling to the batteries; this was harder, as a lot of the electrical wires are in hard-to-access places, but my best-effort visual inspection couldn.t find any problems. So unfortunately, still in the dark as to what.s wrong here, and we'll probably end up having to hire a marine electrician to take a look for us.

One of the discussion topics in the afternoon had been trying to be more intentional and balanced in setting up night watch schedules, and as part of this I.d agreed to sleep from 8 pm to 1 am and then take the 1-6 shift, so I went to bed early last night. Thankfully, one of Ted.s projects Tuesday morning had been getting the monitor windvane self-steering working, and last night.s watch was my first chance to use it. I have to say, I was really impressed at how huge of a difference it made. All my previous night watches had been tortuous, hours of staring at a compass and constantly adjusting the wheel to hold course. With the windvane to help, plus a Zune full of music and a fresh 5 hour nap just beforehand, the watch wasn.t bad at all. I even let Aaron sleep in til 7:30 or so, because I was feeling fine.

Today has also been pretty calm winds and seas, but we've been checking the weather forecast over VHF radio (thank God for NOAA broadcasts) and they.re calling for pretty heavy winds (30 knots, gusting to 40) over the next 3 days. So we put the nice weather to good use, talking through our storm management plans in detail, and practicing rigging all our storm sails. As I'm writing, the winds have already started picking up, and we're back over 6 knots for the first time in days. I feel a lot more confident now than even a week ago, though, and have faith that we'll be just fine. Hopefully I won't eat those words.

As I get into more of a rhythm with life at sea, I've been trying to work in more time for historical documentation like this log. I've been taking many pictures and videos, which I hope to incorporate in with these writings eventually, making a multi-media record of the journey. If you.re reading this log, whether you.re my/Ted.s parents, our friends, a random sailor (or would-be sailor) who somehow stumbled upon it, or myself 20 years down the road, I hope you appreciate the effort J

		<description><![CDATA[As forecast, the winds have picked up pretty significantly today. The night wasn.t too bad, but from morning onwards it's been gradually building, and now we're up to about 25 knots of wind with about 10. seas. This is about as heavy weather as we've seen so far on the trip.

Unlike the last time we had rough weather, though, I think we're actually pretty well prepared this time. It's actually kind of remarkable how much more comfortable and confident we are handling the boat than just a week ago.

Having gone through all our heavy weather plans in detail, today was just a simple matter of putting those plans into practice. As the winds rose, we put in a reef, then later a second, then a few hours after that took down the mizzen, and then swapped the staysail for the storm jib. Now we're down to just a storm jib and a triple-reefed main, and despite the fact that we're still doing 6-7 knots, I think this sailplan should hold us through the night and tomorrow.

Now that we're actually feeling comfortable in this weather, we can step back and appreciate what it does for our speed. If we keep this up, we have a good shot at getting into San Francisco on Saturday, perhaps even Saturday morning. Just a few days back we were projecting getting in Sunday night at best. It feels pretty damn good to be harnessing the power of the wind and sea so successfully.

With the end of the trip in sight, we're starting to think about what we need to do when we get there. After finishing this entry, I'm going to get to work on our (non-trivial) to-do list. Ted is very anxious to get out of SF and leave for Hawaii as fast as possible, and although we have a bit of an ongoing dispute as to whether this puts us at risk of catching the tail end of the East Pacific hurricane season, I'm certainly in favor of trying to be ready to leave as quickly as we can be. In order to make that happen, we'll have to sort through a pretty decent list of problems and issues that surfaced during this leg, so being ready to .hit the ground running. as soon as we're ashore will be important.

The proximity of our arrival at our destination is also slowly but steadily building our excitement at a return to the niceties of civilized land. We.ve had more than one conversation about what delicious meal(s) we're looking forward to on shore, and the thought of a long hot shower, clean clothes, and a (much-needed) shave is almost too tantalizing to contemplate. Man that.s going to feel good.

		<description><![CDATA[We had a fun night riding in front of some pretty good winds and waves last night. Ted said that during his watch, he saw our GPS read speeds up to 12 knots, during some of the best surfing. It would have been pretty intimidating a week ago, but with a bit more ocean experience under our belt, it was actually a lot of fun. We did have one incident during the night though.

Around 3:30 or 4 am, a few hours into my watch shift, I had a bit of a problem with the monitor windvane self-steering. It wasn.t major, but in trying to fix it, I accidentally jibed, and in trying to come out of the jibe I broke open a part of the monitor rigging. On top of that, the jib sheets had gotten tangled up around the sail, so I was a bit overwhelmed. Fortunately, Ted heard the noise and came up to help. It took us 30 minutes or so, but we managed to fix everything and get back underway, without any lasting harm to ourselves or the boat/equipment. Given the pretty rough conditions, as the worst thing that happened all night, it wasn.t that bad, and was evidence of how much our handling of the boat has improved already.

As the day wore on today, the winds and seas subsided, and bit by bit we let out our sails again. We.ve been running under full sails (not counting the still-torn Genoa) for three or four hours now, making about six knots and rapidly closing in on San Francisco. It's going to be close whether or not we get there before sunset tomorrow night. Given how much we'd all appreciate a real meal, a hot shower, and sleeping in non-rocking beds, we might just push through and arrive in the dark; we'll see.

In preparation for coming in, we broke out our charts of the area (we'll be using paper charts, as we opted not to spend $200 for the electronic .US Pacific Coast. chip when all we need is SF). We also browsed through our cruising guidebook, which has details on the approach, lists of marinas and contact info. We.ll be arriving without a working engine (and possibly at night) so we want to be as ready as possible beforehand.

I'm going to really enjoy getting back on land for a few days, but I'm not letting myself get too excited about it. They.ll be super busy days, with a huge to-do list already piling up, and it won't be long at all before we're back on the water headed for Hawaii. Still, it would be foolish not to enjoy at least a little rest and relaxation while we can, right?

		<description><![CDATA[The weather calmed down a lot today, and with light winds and no Genoa we made slow progress. The slowdown meant not making it in to San Francisco today, unfortunately, but we're in good shape to get there pretty early tomorrow morning.

Calm weather has its downsides for our speed, but it did make for a beautiful day out on the water. We.re starting to be able to notice the 700 miles or so we've gone south since leaving Seattle, and while it wasn.t exactly hot out, the midday sun was warm enough to tempt us into a little sunbathing on the foredeck. As a (very small) preview of the equatorial weather we'll hopefully have for most of the trip, it was extremely enticing, and I can hardly wait to get down to the tropics.

Our approach into SF has us coming into land a good 25-30 miles north of the city, around Point Reyes, from where we'll sail down along the coast, then in under the Golden Gate Bridge. A nice side-benefit of this approach is that we should get into cell phone range a good 4-5 hours before we arrive at the city, so we'll be able to call ahead and hopefully check in with marinas to see if a slip is available.

Over the past 4-5 days, our watches have settled into a pretty regular pattern, with my shift coming from about 2 am to 10 am. As a result, I've gotten onto a bit of a crazy sleep schedule, typically passing out from about 8:30 pm to 1:30 am and then getting a couple hour nap in the afternoon. With our return to land imminent, I'm going to need (or at least want) to get back onto a normal schedule, so there may be a rough day or two of readjusting. Of course, once we leave for Hawaii I'll probably get right back onto the same schedule, so I almost wonder if it's worth changing back. but sleeping normal hours will make it a lot easier to interact with the rest of the world.

For now, though, I'm going to rack out and try to get rested up for our arrival tomorrow morning. It's going to be an exciting day!

		<description><![CDATA[Greetings everyone!

Just a quick note that, to confirm the SPOT update, we've arrived safely in San Francisco. There is QUITE a lot more to the story than that, but for now, we're heading out for a much-needed steak dinner and a night of relaxing. Stories, reflections, pictures, videos, etc. will be forthcoming as soon as I get a chance.

Thanks to all who sent us mail cheering us on!

Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[It's been just over a week since our arrival in San Francisco, and I've been so preoccupied with the various celebrations, welcomes, well-wishes, repairs, and preparations, that I haven.t had time to revisit this log and tell the final bit of the story. There.s still a lot left to do before we head out, so I won't make this super detailed, but I'll endeavor to fill in enough to have a complete record of events.

The last entry left us a little ways off the California coast, hoping to make Point Reyes and subsequently San Francisco the next morning. Well, as we approached land, the winds continued to subside and subside, taking our speed first to a walk and then to a crawl. Right as the sun peered over the horizon during my morning watch shift, I caught sight of the rocky promontory upon which the Point Reyes lighthouse perches. However, my excitement at the first land we'd seen in nine days was rapidly replaced by frustration, as the last remnants of wind gave out, and we slowly came to a dead stop. We were adrift, 30 miles north of San Francisco, with no engine and no wind.

Around 8 am, Aaron got up, and when I apprised him of our situation he shared my frustration. What.s more, unlike me and Ted, he had a vested interest in making it into the city as early as possible, because he had to be at work in New York on Wednesday and had many friends in the Bay Area he hoped to visit. After some discussion, we agreed to radio the Coast Guard for a tow, and Aaron would pay whatever the charge was (we didn.t really know what this number would be, but assumed that from 30 miles away it wouldn.t be cheap).

At first, we had some doubt as to whether or not our VHF radio even worked, as we had never actually transmitted anything over it. In fact, I was a little intimidated by the process, because there.s a fair amount of etiquette around use of VHF, and I hate looking/feeling like an idiot. Fortunately, hours of listening to others. chatter on VHF channel 16 (the channel reserved for ship-to-ship hailing and emergencies) had given us a pretty good handle on the proper procedures. We successfully hailed the Coast Guard, switched to a working channel, described our situation, and got a boat sent our way.

It took about an hour and a half for the boat to get up to our position, then a few minutes to rig up the towing bridle, and we were on our way south. I have to say, I was really impressed by the guys from the Coast Guard: they were professional, skilled, and courteous. Within a few hours they had us safely pulled in to a dock at the Presidio Yacht Club in Sausalito, just underneath the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Upon our arrival, we were met by a couple nice Coast Guard officers, who asked to do a safety inspection of our boat. They checked through to make sure we had all the USCG-required gear: signal flares, a horn, PFDs (Personal Flotation Devices, a.k.a. life jackets), fire extinguishers, documentation for the boat, etc. Let that be a lesson to all you other boaters out there: really do make sure you have all this stuff! Fortunately for us, we got a clean report card, and they sent us on our way with a smile. The best part of all: zero charge, for the entire tow! (We still can.t believe our luck on this one.)

Ted.s dad, Phil, met us at the dock, and was generous enough to take us out to a fantastic steak dinner (after we'd each taken a deeply restorative shower at the hotel). We allowed ourselves a night of celebration and relaxation Sunday night, but since then we've been hard at work trying to resolve all the issues that arose on this first leg.

We hired a local marine mechanic to come look at our v-drive. After they removed it and disassembled it, they informed us that the whole piece was shot (as we had feared but expected), and ordered a new one for us. The good news was that the part was in stock at the original manufacturer, so we would not have to wait long, but the bad news was the $2400 price tag (plus labor).

Next on the list was the Genoa. We took this in to a sail-maker.s shop, and after a quick look, they said that the damage was repairable but they would need to order a piece of canvas. This, again, was good news but came with a $700 price tag. On the plus side, they said that the sail looked like it had been previously repaired poorly, and that it was very worn. In other words, while we may have slightly exacerbated the problem by our handling, the sail was already in bad shape, and probably would have needed professional repair sooner than later anyway.

Then we moved to an unexpected problem: when we had arrived at the docks, we noticed that the paddle on our windvane (a critical piece that translates wind direction into steering movements) had snapped off sometime during our tow. We hit a bit of good luck here as well, as the company that makes the Monitor windvane happens to be located right in San Francisco, so Ted and Phil made a trip there in search of a replacement. In so doing, we realized that our windvane was 24 years old, and so again a breakdown wasn.t that huge of a surprise. This one looks like it may also cost us a few hundred dollars, but we may catch a break, as someone at the marina miraculously happened upon the broken paddle along the shore, and returned it to the marina office. The connection was shot, but the piece itself was intact, so we may not need to buy a whole new one after all.

Then comes the SSB radio. Here, I wanted to make an attempt to diagnose the issue myself, as it's good practice at doing some basic marine electrical troubleshooting. We picked up a good multimeter and a handbook for marine maintenance, and I tried a few basic steps to see if something obvious was wrong. I didn.t have any luck though, so we will have to have an electrician look at it after all.

Besides all those major items, we've picked up a bunch of various spare parts and equipment, and are generally much better outfitted now than we were before. There.s still some lingering work to be done, but we're ambitiously shooting to be ready to leave by Wednesday the 7th.

This entry has been written on a plane from Boston back to San Francisco. My mother wasn.t able to make it out to SF, as she had originally planned, for medical reasons. So to get one last chance to say bye to her, I took a redeye home on Saturday night. We had a lovely visit and I'm glad I made it back. Now, my Dad and I are headed for the boat, and he.s hoping to see Ted and I off. I'm tremendously glad for the support of both my parents, and I wanted to put it in writing just once for the record: Mom, Dad, I love you both; thanks for everything.

		<description><![CDATA[Just read Kevin's account - sounds like he's suffering from a serious case of the sea madness.  Disregard all of that.  Here are some things that happened: 

- We all agreed that losing a finger is *not* sufficient grounds for deploying the EPIRB, unless you still have the finger and it looks re-attachable, in which case go for it. 
- After 3-odd days without seeing another ship, and extensive discussion about how far off the coast we should be to avoid shipping lanes, we finally spotted a tiny speck of a ship wayy off on the horizon.  Aaron's shout of "They're coming right for us!"  had us in tears.
- It's kinda loud on deck, but inside the cabin the sounds are magnified.  Any time we were moving fast and you're down below it'd sound like the ship was tearing itself apart and ready to rip in half any minute.  I'm 80% confident that's totally normal. 
- Scariest moment: picture it - it's pitch black out, winds gusting, rain and spray everywhere, biggest waves you've seen yet crashing into the boat, and the biggest sail you have has worked free and is flailing around wildly out of control from the forestay, literally tearing itself apart in front of your eyes.  Two 50' lines are attached to it, and the wind is whipping them all over the deck.  Now you have to go fix it. 
- Best moment:  Flying downwind in heavy seas.  Three reefs in the main w/ a storm jib, still above hull speed.  Close second:  dropping that first huge, glorious deuce back ashore, w/out worrying about sloshing.
- Main lesson learned:  Eat all the time.  Just keep eating.  Are you doing something important that requires both hands?  No?  Use the other hand to eat.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi again!

I'm about to head out of the hotel with my Dad, to embark on one last round of errands, and hopefully end up with a ready-for-departure Kallisti by this evening. Ted and I are planning to motor our way out of San Francisco Bay tomorrow morning, get a little distance off the coast, and then strike southwest for some tropical Hawaiian waters.

I may not get another chance at net access before we leave, so a few notes:

    * Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to finish writing up the trip report for the first leg. The last week has been pretty packed, and I really want to take the time to do this well, as I hope to be re-reading it for years to come. So, I'll finish it up during the trip to Hawaii, and hopefully the quality will be worth the wait Smile emoticon
    * Videos are on my laptop, but it turns out netbooks make highly mediocre video editing machines (1024x600 resolution is apparently not a regular test case for most video editing apps). Therefore, video compositions will be another thing you can all look forward to, though these may not get put together until after the trip (or maybe a few months from now, if I manage to find a better computer system to work on for a few hours).
    * Please DO NOT e-mail our sailmail address if we haven't specifically talked to you about it. The bandwidth for accessing it is extremely limited, and we want to keep it open for urgent mails only. (We had intended to keep the address hidden entirely, but a slight technical glitch leaked it in one of the earlier e-mails. If you happened to see/save it then, please don't use it.) To send us well-wishes etc. while we're at sea, just use our regular addresses (klitwack@hotmail.com, ted.abbot@gmail.com), and we'll see them when we come ashore.

Other than that, this leg should be much like the last. We'll keep the SPOT updates coming just like before (the first one tomorrow will let you know when we're under way), and I'll do my best to keep up the ship's log entries. We also should have a working SSB, which should mean we can send sailmail updates, but nothing's guaranteed in the open ocean.

With luck, we'll be in Hawaii in about 3 weeks, and we'll tell you all about it!

Cheers,
Kevin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We're on our way to Hawaii! What an eventful first stop in San Francisco. In my last entry I described many of the more notable bits of our repair and preparation process. Since then, we had our hands full completing all those various bits and pieces. On Monday afternoon we took care of the windvane; on Tuesday morning the new v-drive was installed, and the same afternoon we picked up our repaired Genoa. Wednesday was provisioning day, with a Costco trip and a grocery store trip (for smaller quantities of fresh foods) keeping us busy.

A few particular quirks of the preparation process stand out as being worth some individual description. First, we had a much harder time than expected getting our hands on a seemingly simple item: paper charts for Hawaii. We had been planning on relying on electronic charts, courtesy of Navionics, the supplier for our brand out chartplotter. However, we found out that the chip we'd been hoping to get (covering Hawaii and the Western Pacific) wasn't available at West Marine, and they'd have to special-order it, which we didn't have time for. This alone didn't seem like a big deal; we could easily navigate into Hawaii with paper charts (as we'd planned to do for San Francisco). But after extensive searching, we couldn't find anywhere in the area that still sells the (apparently) anachronistic paper.

We resolved this, more or less, with some creative application of technology. NOAA makes an extensive catalog of "raster nautical charts," or RNCs, available for download on their website. We popped into a Starbucks (for net access) and I downloaded most of the applicable Hawaiian charts, along with a program for viewing them. After about an hour at a nearby Kinko's, and much fighting with file types and resolutions and the like, we managed to get 24"x36" printed copies of the three most critical ones, with a small enough amount of image degradation that it's (mostly) legible.

The other entertaining story is the mysterious tale of our SSB. After several failed attempts to get an electrician to come look at the unit aboard our boat, we finally just brought it in to him to take a look. He did some basic probing and couldn't find anything wrong, so he said he'd have to come out. This was Wednesday afternoon, and we hoped to leave the next morning. We communicated this timeline to him, but the best he could promise was a visit "first thing tomorrow morning." Not having much choice, we went to bed hoping this would be good enough.

Then, providence struck: Ted happened to try turning on the SSB (which I had wired back up), and magically, it worked! When I woke up in the morning he pointed this out to me, and I played with all the various features: full functionality was restored. (For those who followed us online, you may have seen the SailMail I sent.) As best as we can guess, the problem must have been that the SSB requires a really fully charge on the batteries, and we'd let them run a little bit too low. Plugging in to shore power in SF kicked them back full enough for the SSB to work again. At least, that's our current theory. Presumably the trip to Hawaii will provide validation one way or the other. Oh, and by the way, the electrician never called Thursday morning, so I guess it's a good thing it started working on its own.

One last little story worth mentioning from the San Fran stay: the moorage fee at Travis Marina, where we docked. Bear in mind, this is not a public marina, and normally a sailboat like us couldn't just hop in there and stay for 10 days. We got lucky because the Coast Guard towed us in, and (with permission of the harbormaster) dropped us at that marina because it was close, convenient, and had space. Over the 10 days we were there, we got to know Louis (the harbormaster), and he was a great guy. Friendly, helpful, and almost embarrassingly accommodating of our various requests and needs (which he had no obligation whatsoever to care about). Among many other good deeds, when it came time for us to settle up, he only charged us a total of $120, an absurdly cheap rate for the location. We gave him a $20 tip, and a case of Anchor Steam J

Anyway, all that San Francisco business is behind us now. We got a good start at about 10 this morning and headed down south for Half Moon Bay, where we planned to refuel, refill our water tanks, and pump out our holding tank. We could have gone up into downtown Sausalito to take care of all this, but it was a little out of the way, and expensive to boot ($10/hour for transient moorage). After 4-ish hours of exercise for our freshly-functional engine, we arrived at our last stop before Hawaii.

Half Moon Bay is a beautiful little harbor, and as the sun melted away the last of the morning.s thick cloud cover, we pulled into the fuel dock. Filling/emptying our various tanks didn't take long, and then we left the boat tied up and grabbed a bite at a shore-side restaurant. Why not take advantage of the opportunity, when we have three weeks of Costco food to look forward to? The meal finished, we had one final critical task to take care of.

On the way down from San Francisco, we realized we'd made a catastrophic mistake during our supply-shopping the previous day. We had bought a big bag of potatoes, intending to use them in stews, or even just fry them in slices and eat them with ketchup. Only we forgot to buy any ketchup! So once lunch was done, I headed up the road, found the nearest gas station, and bought two 22 ounce bottles of ketchup; crisis narrowly averted.

We headed back to the boat, took care of a couple last little tuning issues, and cast off for real. As we pulled out, I saw the tip of a small line disappear over the side of the boat and into the water. I ran back to the stern, to see it slowly falling irretrievably into the depths. It was the lead line we had rigged, which Ted had been using to experiment on an old hydraulic release, purely out of scientific curiosity. (A lead line is simply a lead weight tied to a line with 10. segments marked off, which can be used as a fallback means of determining bottom depth.) If we had to lose a piece of gear, this is probably the least critical one to lose, and in fact if we treat it as a sacrifice to Poseidon, maybe it was a blessing in disguise. With a little luck, that will satisfy our mishap quota for the trip, which would be fine by me.

There.s no wind to speak of right now, so we're motoring out offshore for the evening. Once the winds pick up, or we get far enough out, or we get tired of listening to the engine, we'll shut it down. Our course for this leg is staggeringly simple (particularly compared to the last one). Pretty much, we head southwest for 2200 nautical miles, and then turn right and motor into Honolulu. As one of the longest, if not the longest, individual leg of our whole itinerary, it promises to be quite an interesting experience.

		<description><![CDATA[Our route from Half Moon Bay to Honolulu is just over 2200 nautical miles. To make it in three weeks, we would need to average just over 100 nautical miles per day. As of this writing, we've been out for about 35 hours, and have traveled a total of 90 miles. Of those 35 hours, around 15 have been under engine. Talk about uncooperative winds: we've barely had a breath. Oh well, so much for getting a good start.

The upside of the light winds has been a chance to get settled back into life at sea without having to deal with the discomforts and challenges of rougher weather. It's also been an opportunity to put into practice some of the living improvements we thought of during the stay in San Francisco. Here are a few examples.

Dealing with boredom during watches is no small task. It took some effort even on our trip from Seattle, and that was with three people. Now that it's just me and Ted, and the novelty of life on the open ocean is wearing off, keeping occupied requires real thought. In the past, such as during some of my cross-country driving, I've had great success with audio books, so I thought I.d give those a try here. In San Francisco, I signed up for an Audible account, and grabbed a handful of books I've wanted to read for a while. During my watch last night, I made it through Animal Farm, which I'm ashamed to say I hadn.t read before. I enjoyed it, but more importantly, it did make the watch pass quickly, so by all accounts that.s a big success. I'm looking forward to some of my other selections.

Another entertainment source was recommended to me by my friend Skipper, who pointed me at a radio/podcast series from NPR called Radio Lab. It's a series of 30- or 60-minute conversations about a wide range of interesting (and often mind-bending) intellectual subjects. Yesterday afternoon, while I was cooking dinner, I put on the episode .(So-Called) Life.. It was pretty crazy, and easily provided enough mental stimulation to keep my mind occupied for a while. Some of the other episodes sound even weirder, and promise to take my mind off the tedium of watchkeeping for many hours. Thanks Skip!

Speaking of cooking dinner, another area where Ted and I hoped to improve over our first leg.s experience was in our meals. We decided to be a bit more ambitious in our cooking goals, and bought a handful of fresh veggies to experiment with. So far, I've cooked two meals with these, and both have come out pretty well. Thursday night we sliced up some potatoes and simmered them in a little vegetable oil and spices, then served with ketchup. Yesterday, dinner was a stir-fry of carrots, celery, onion, red pepper, and shredded chicken in teriyaki sauce. Tasty.

There is one piece of minor bad news. The SSB, which we thought we'd gotten sorted out, died again in the middle of trying to connect to SailMail yesterday afternoon. It seems as though our hypothesis that it was just low battery power last time was wrong after all. Signs now point to a problem in the wiring. It must just be a loose cable or connection somewhere, because the problem seems to come and go. This will be a good challenge for my electrical troubleshooting skills, and as soon as it gets light out again, I'll pull out the multimeter and see what I can find.

Not having wind is really a huge frustration, so hopefully we'll get a breeze soon. We figure we can afford about 25 hours of engine time just for motoring through dead air (saving 15 hours for recharging batteries and 10 for getting into port, and conservatively estimating our fuel economy). That means we only have another 10 hours left, and I'm not sure I can stand much more of it anyway. We.re here to sail, not burn diesel. Wind gods, if you.re reading this, I.d really appreciate it if you can send 15 knots our way.

		<description><![CDATA[We.ve gone from totally becalmed (which sucked) to a light, variable wind from the southwest, our intended course (which sucks only slightly less). And the forecast is for just about the only thing worse than both. More on that later, though.

The calm weather has, at least, afforded us some opportunities to rest and take care of the boat. Saturday, in particular, was a bit of a .project day. for us. In the morning, I set out to troubleshoot the SSB. This was a fun little task that involved  emptying out both lazarettes and trying to trace the wiring from the SSB to the batteries, looking for something amiss. I'm fairly proud to say that, with a little guesswork and some luck, I tracked the issue down to a broken fuse. It happens that in San Francisco I picked up a few packets of various spare fuses, so we had a suitable replacement, and after I popped it in the SSB worked fine. So we're back up and running on the comms front!

We also took out our newly-purchased solar panel, and figured we'd give that a whirl. It was actually quite easy to set up, and by early afternoon the sun had worked its way through most of the clouds, yielding decent weather for solar energy collection. We left the panel up all afternoon, and as best as I could tell with a multimeter, we did manage to get a trickle of power fed back into the batteries. Not a lot, to be sure, but maybe enough to stave off having to recharge via the engine for a bit.

Sometime around then, we had a fun little encounter with a couple whales. They swam around us rather playfully for 5 or 10 minutes, and I managed to get some good photos/video of them. These were massive animals; I think they may have been bigger than our boat. Seeing them up close really gave me an appreciation for how incredible they are. I'm not a whale expert, so I can.t say what kind they were, but hopefully the video is enough for someone following us to identify them.

While the lazarettes were open, Ted noticed we had a hose that was slowly leaking seawater. We spent a little while trying to trace it, to figure out what it was for and why it was leaking. We traced it, we think, to the watermaker, which we still haven.t tried using so we're not entirely sure how all the pieces interact. Just to be safe, we cleaned out a filter on the hose that we noticed was really clogged, and then put it back, trying to minimize the leak.

It was sometime during the process of tracing this line that I accidentally dropped my camera into the bilge. I grabbed it back out pretty quickly, but the damage was done: there was enough saltwater and oil that it seems the camera is permanently destroyed. The only silver lining is that the memory card, which had the whale pictures/video (and some other good shots I hadn.t uploaded to my computer yet) was salvaged, and I managed to get the data off it. Guess I'll be buying a new camera in Hawaii (if the winds ever pick up enough that we make it there).

Oh yes, which brings me back to the winds. With our repaired SSB, we hopped onto weatherfax and picked up the 24- and 48-hour forecasts for the east Pacific. Excitingly enough, there.s a gale headed our way. This information in and of itself isn.t so bad; in general, we're comfortable sailing in that kind of wind, and it does let us make good speed. Unfortunately, the forecast is for the winds where we are to be dead out of the southwest. If there.s one thing more unhelpful than a light and variable wind on your nose, it's a 35 knot blow right on your nose. Uck.

So, we've once again started mentally preparing ourselves for a couple unpleasant days. Our major decision is whether to favor heading west-northwest, or south-southeast. Both move us in one good direction and one bad one. South is appealing in that it puts us closer to warmer weather, but west may leave us in the path of more favorable winds as the storm passes. It's a tough call, which we still need to think over, possibly informed by tomorrow.s weatherfax data.

Once the weather gets rough it may be hard for me to get to writing this log, so apologies in advance if there.s a few days. gap. I'm sure the reader will forgive me.

Weather nicer today; still southwest wind but forecast looks promising. Nurturing cautious optimism despite slow start - the tropics (and trade winds) await!

		<description><![CDATA[Well, the storm.s past and we survived (mostly) unharmed. It was definitely a strong blow though, at least comparable to the weather we had on the way down from Seattle. What's more, unlike the Oregon-coast storm, this time we were obligated to try and head into the gale, as its winds were coming hard from the southwest. Upwind sailing is always rougher going (there's a saying: "A gentleman always sails downwind"), so our first trip head-on into 30+ knot winds was definitely an experience.

Ted got the worst of it. During his night shift while the weather was still picking up, our anchor got knocked off the bow roller. I was asleep, and in his haste to try and deal with it before it did serious damage, he ran up without waking me. He had the fun task of trying to secure it back in place while the bow was plunging over and over again into 10-15 foot waves, and by the time he managed to get back to the cabin and wake me up to take over for him, he was drenched and exhausted.

My shift through the storm wasn.t nearly as eventful or demanding, but it was still a harrowing experience. Let's not mince words here: the open ocean in 30 knots of wind is a kind of intense scene. I wouldn't say I was scared, per se, as we were quite conservatively canvassed (triple-reefed main and almost fully-furled Genoa). But even without animalistic fear the heel of the boat, the perpetual pounding of the waves into the hull, the rain, and the howling wind do comprise a formidable sensory assault. It was hard not to think about what a real ocean storm, a hurricane, would be like. Terrifying comes to mind. So does awesome, in the literal "awe-inspiring" sense, but I'd rather avoid it just the same.

Both Ted and I were running on mere fumes after our respective shifts through the storm Monday night, so rather than our usual schedule of a six or eight hour overlap with both of us awake, just about all of Tuesday passed with one or the other of us asleep. Tuesday night saw the weather gradually subside. By the time I got up around 1 am, Ted had pulled out a couple reefs in both sails, and by sunrise I had undone the rest and raised the mizzen, putting us back up to full canvas. Normally we'd feel triumphant and exuberant to see our way through a storm like that, but unfortunately, this storm subsided into a lingering wind that still blew right on our nose. It was as if somebody in Oahu had pointed a big fan right at us.

All day Wednesday continued the trend: light winds out of the southwest. We were rapidly approaching the one-week mark since our departure from Half Moon Bay, and so far, the only weather we'd seen was either (a) becalmed, (b) light southwest wind, or (c) gusting southwest gale. For a route purported to have reliably favorable north/northeast/east winds all the way to Hawaii, we were beginning to feel a little frustrated. No, I should be clear: I was beginning to feel extremely frustrated. In typical fashion, Ted seemed mostly fine with it, though maybe he's just better an internalizing his boiling rage than I am.

Let me try to help the reader understand the frustration of this experience. Imagine you've been out at sea for six days. Some have been pretty unpleasant (the storm), some not so bad, but that's expected, that's just life at sea. What's not expected is that after all that, you're a scant 250 miles or so from your port of departure. In fact, the majority of those miles were covered under engine power, and consumed just about all of your discretionary fuel (i.e. everything not saved for recharging batteries, getting into port, and other emergencies).

Now you're stuck going 2-3 knots, at best, and at an angle about 50-60 degrees off from your desired course. (Sailboats, for the land-lubber portion of the audience, can't sail right at the wind, and thus have a metaphorical "blind spot" in their available course options. Trying to sail towards a point directly behind where the wind's coming from is a tedious zig-zag process called "beating," and the name is well-deserved.) Doing some quick math tells you that at this pace, you're on schedule to cruise into Honolulu in another three months or so. I don't know about you, but for me, that thought is disheartening.

I think sometime during my watch last night/this morning, I hit rock bottom. I found myself, once again, wondering if this trip was worth it. If maybe I wouldn't have been better off just sticking with life in Seattle, at that very instant sleeping in my warm bed after a night of revelry with friends or relaxing on the couch. It was an enticing mental image, and a dark moment for my motivation to keep pursuing this ridiculous, artificial, meaningless goal.

It was amidst these thoughts that I came up with a thought experiment that restored my hope and renewed my commitment to seeing this through. I think, or at least hope, that this thought experiment can be used for a variety of circumstances; it has the feel of a generalized motivational tool that I can carry forward with me through my future life challenges. I've been calling it the .Surrender Button..

I imagined that there is a big, red button, prominently located right above my bunk in the cabin. Written on the button, in big, inviting letters are the words "I Surrender." Below is a placard with instructions:

Push this button to give up. You will be instantly transported to a Universe in which you never embarked upon this endeavor. Your life will proceed as though you.d never even thought to try. There will be no failure, no remorse, no wasted time or effort or money. You will erase your mistake.

Then, I looked myself straight in the soul, and asked, "Do I push the button?" I forced myself to remember why I set out to do this in the first place. I imagined trying to explain to the former me, the one who decided this was the right thing to do in my life, the one resolutely committed to growing as a person, why I felt it necessary to push this button. Was a little frustration at a slow start, a little drowsiness from some long nights, really so bad as to give up on a dream?

So today I've been feeling much better. I shaved, took a shower (well, a soapy rinse anyway), and changed into clean clothes, all of which were deeply refreshing. (Ted opted for the bold approach of a quick dive into the ocean, which he assured me was deeply refreshing as well, but I decided to hold back on that one until the tropics.) In the afternoon we had a thick fog, which gradually melted away under a persistent sun, and as evening approached a gorgeous rainbow flew along behind us. The entire semi-circle was visible, and it appeared to be just a few hundred feet back, chasing us as we glided along the water. Surely that.s a good omen, if anything is.

The forecasts we've been tracking over weatherfax do seem to suggest we might finally get a break soon, as the high pressure system that.s been stalled over us finally moves on. As I'm writing this the winds seem to have started shifting favorably, and for the first time this entire trip we're not close hauled (for non-sailors, "close hauled" is the term for sailing into the wind). There is a deeply naive optimist somewhere inside me that believes, like an innocent child, that once we can finally just get the wind at our backs, we'll have two weeks of gorgeous sunny skies and cruising at 6 knots, and be lying on Waikiki by Halloween. At any rate, that's as good a thought as any to try and inject into my dreams, so I'm off to sleep.

		<description><![CDATA[The favorable winds have held, so far, and we've been making steady progress southwest for almost a full 24 hours now. Most of that time has been a light-to-moderate breeze, pushing us along at 3-4 knots, although during my shift this morning there were a few brief moments where we touched 6. Either way, it's been a novelty actually aiming in the right direction, and a very welcome change.

I really hope that we see a lot more of this type of weather (as we're theoretically statistically likely to), because it's a completely different and entirely more pleasant experience from the last week. With the windvane set, the boat mostly takes care of itself, requiring only an occasional tweak or adjustment every 15-20 minutes. This leaves a lot of free time to relax, to take care of odds and ends (both personal and boat-related), and to actually enjoy yourself.

I, for my part, have taken advantage of this by diving into the substantial book collection I brought, both audio and paper. Slaughterhouse 5, in audio form, provided one night shift.s entertainment. I also finished up a book called Blessed Unrest that I thoroughly enjoyed, and started into Infinite Jest, a thousand-page tome which promises to keep me busy for a while. In parallel, my next audio endeavor is Anathem, and after the first 20% I'm already totally hooked. To be honest, I haven.t done much reading over the last few years, and it feels fantastic to be re-immersing myself in the pastime.

Something else I was going to mention yesterday, but forgot, is that our power (battery) situation has been going well. We didn.t run the engine at all from Saturday night through Thursday morning, meaning we got 4.5 days out of just one battery charge. We may have gotten a little help from the solar panel, which we had out for a while Monday, but I doubt it was a huge contribution. I think we've just been doing a pretty good job of not using much power. Just about our only electricity-eaters are our nav system, the SSB radio, our running lights at night, and recharging my laptop and Zune. As modern cruising sailboats go, I guess that.s a pretty light load.

Our culinary successes continue to abound as well. We.ve had bacon twice, eggs twice, hash browns three times (with onions once), a vegetable-chicken stir fry, pancakes several times (with apples once, Ted.s doing), franks and beans twice, corn twice, cinnamon buns, and just this afternoon I baked some pumpkin spice bread (store-bought powder kind, but still delicious). Everything.s been pretty delicious, and I really don.t feel like I've been eating any less enjoyable food than I do on land. Of course, being ravenously hungry most of the time may bias that opinion a bit, but our food so far has been indisputable better than what we ate most of the way from Seattle to SF. Sadly, we're nearly out of fresh foods, and our ice is just about gone anyway. Even if our menu degrades a bit from here on, I'm satisfied that we made a solid effort on the food front.

If there.s one lingering annoyance, it's that the windvane has been working less and less well of late, and requiring more and more tweaking and attention. After a lot of fidgeting and investigation, we're beginning to suspect that the wheel itself has gotten tight, seemingly as a result of poor lubrication (or something in the electronic autopilot. Unlike the windvane, the electronic autopilot has a piece that attaches directly to the wheel, and has to be turned with the wheel even when it is disengaged. It seems like this has gotten gummed up or stuck somehow.

Fortunately, with moderate and favorable winds and not much else to worry about, we can take the time to pull apart the autopilot and see what.s wrong. There.s a good chance it's a simple issue that we can fix pretty easily. So, that.s what we're about to do, and as such I'm going to end this entry here. Until next time.

		<description><![CDATA[Today continued the generally favorable weather. My early morning shift, in particular, was great: cruising along at 5-6 knots just about straight southwest, on a lovely beam reach. Our autopilot troubleshooting yesterday afternoon was semi-successful, in that we managed to take the whole device off the wheel. This did solve the sticking we'd been seeing/feeling in the steering, which did in turn improve the windvane.s performance as we'd hoped. Unfortunately, there.s still a wire attaching the otherwise-disconnected autopilot to the steering column, so it's just lashed awkwardly to the side. Not pretty, but not really a problem either, so we can try to figure out what to do with it at our leisure now.

As the day's worn on, the wind has continued to be from a good direction, but it has gradually petered out a bit. We.ve slowed to 3-ish knots, which prompted a lively debate between me and Ted about whether we ought to adjust our course a little bit to the south to try and gain better winds. The weather data we've been getting seems to suggest a stronger breeze to our southeast, which implies we might get better speed if we inch out in that direction. The counterargument is that the more we deviate from a straight line to Honolulu, the longer our path becomes, and it's not clear where the optimal balance of these two factors lies. We ended up deciding to just err a bit on the side of south, but not make any drastic alterations to our planned route.

We did take the .erring south. decision as an opportunity to try out running wing-and-wing using our whisker pole, with which we hadn.t yet experimented. (For non-sailors, this is a method/piece of equipment, respectively, used to help sail dead downwind, which for various reasons can be tricky otherwise.) After a bit of fiddling about with it, we got it working alright, but the winds were so light by then that it was hard to keep the sails filled, and after a bit we gave up on it. I'm glad we gave it a shot though, as it does seem like a useful weapon in our sail plan arsenal.

I've been doing some mental arithmetic on an almost daily basis to track how likely/plausible it is for us to make landfall by Halloween. It would be cool to go out to Waikiki bars for the occasion. Right now, though, it's looking like a pretty serious long shot; we'd have to average close to 5 knots for the next two weeks. I've never seen reason to let reality get in the way of naive optimism, though, so I'll keep on hoping.

		<description><![CDATA[Two more days of beautiful weather and decent winds. We.ve had an annoying pattern of the winds dropping off to little or nothing through the middle of the night, but otherwise, we've been making solid progress through the days. Today, we finally crossed 30 degrees north latitude, and can start gradually swinging our course from south-southwest to southwest/west-southwest. Or at least, we'll be able to do so once the winds cooperate; strangely, we're still seeing a west-ish wind, which isn.t really what I.d expected based on forecasts and prevailing weather patterns.

When we were becalmed, it was supremely frustrating. When we were in a gale, it was unpleasant, and somewhat intimidating. Now that we have warm, sunny weather and good winds, the whole experience has become startlingly pleasant. Where before I had often dreaded getting up for my night watches, now they.re not so bad, and can even be enjoyable times to ruminate or read/listen to a book. Similarly the days are relaxing, time to bask in the sun, have random conversations, or experiment with cooking (although we're running out of interesting ingredients). Overall, the degree to which this voyage has apparently linked my daily happiness to the weather conditions is substantial, and unsettling. Guess I'll keep my fingers crossed for good weather.

Ted and I have been splitting the watches pretty much around the 2 am line, give or take: Ted watches from about 6 pm til 2 am, then I get up and take over, until he gets up around 10. Then through the day we're more or less both up, aside from my occasional naps, and watching the boat is more ad hoc. This has been working alright, but in our conversations about it, we've both sort of been feeling like we'd prefer the other.s shift. It may be a case of .the grass is always greener,. or one of us may just not realize how good he.s got it. Either way, we think we're going to try out swapping, and see how it goes.

The tricky thing about swapping is that we have to do it while still keeping watches going, so somehow we have to transition from the current schedule to the new one. Fortunately the nice weather should make this a lot easier, because watches are much less draining, and it's easier to get rest during the day. We.re going to try brute-forcing the problem, each basically just staying up through their new shift. Tentatively, we've slated this operation for Wednesday. We'd do it tomorrow, but I'm signed up to try baking cinnamon-raisin bread tomorrow, and that.s a high-priority operation.

Speaking of food, we've both been surprised at how much we've already gone through. When we loaded up the boat in San Francisco, I was sure we had way more food than we could possibly need. Looking through our stores now, though, we've eaten a huge amount of it. We.re not really in any danger of actually running out, I don.t think, but we've depleted a lot of the snacks and finger food that have been staples of our diet thus far. Now we're down to lots of canned food and non-perishables, much/most of which require cooking in some form. We.ll have to make sure to buy a lot more snack food in Hawaii, which will be our last Costco stop for a while.

I still haven.t made much progress on writing up the SF trip report, so I may take a couple days off writing in this log to try and hammer that out. I want to work on it while it's still (somewhat) fresh in my mind. If it seems like I might be taking all this documentation effort too seriously, it's probably because I am, but somehow it's become really important to me. In a way, I'm afraid that if I don.t record it (for myself and others), I'm wasting a lot of the value and purpose of doing it in the first place.

So, if there.s a gap of a few days following this, assume more of the same: sun, good wind, steady sailing. If anything particularly eventful or exciting happens, I'll come back here sooner.

		<description><![CDATA[You may have noticed that we've started making better time over the last couple days. That's because we're (finally) edging into the trade winds. For a while yesterday we were beam reaching at just over 7 knots. Slowed down a little bit right now, but hopefully we'll see more and more consistent wind from here on. I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll reach Honolulu sometime in the first week of November.

Thanks for following us, your emotional support is appreciated!

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps I should stop giving times in PDT, as I'm pretty sure that we've crossed at least one time zone west by now. (The metric-lover in me can.t resist thinking: one down, twenty to go!) Probably easier to just keep all the clocks set that way, though, until we reach Hawaii. I imagine this seems like a trivial detail, but when you have nothing to do but think for 8+ hours a day, sooner or later trivial details occupy all your attention.

Anyway, I finished up a reasonably satisfactory first draft of my reflections on the Seattle-to-SF leg last night. As anticipated, the last few days have been largely uneventful, so there isn.t all that much terribly new to write about. The steady wind, which I'm increasingly confident is the trade winds after all, has mounted to a pretty consistent 15-20 knots and seems to be more or less steady through the whole day. We.ve had a mix of sun and clouds, and an occasional mist of light rain, but generally it's been quite pleasant. And it's definitely gratifying to watch our position on the map making its way steadily westward.

Ted and I have just about finished our little shift-swapping maneuver, so I'm back onto what I consider a relatively normal sleep schedule, from about 2 am to 10 am. I haven.t quite gotten over the metaphorical jet lag yet, so I can.t say for sure, but I think I like this over what I had before. For one, it means I start my solo-watch shift in the evening when I'm well-rested and generally content. In contrast, the early morning watch starts off with being awoken in the middle of the night in darkness, which inevitably makes for a miserable and grumpy start. We.ll see though, maybe after a week or two of this I'll learn that it has its own particular flavor of miseries.

We.re running the engine now to recharge the batteries, for the first time in eight days. I'm pretty impressed that we could get by for that long on a single charge, plus whatever trickle we collected from our solar panel. It's reassuring to know that our power consumption needs are so low, as it makes me pretty confident we could get by even if the engine or alternator were broken. Also, not having to run the engine for battery-charging means more fuel available to motor when winds are light. Not to mention that running the engine is just kind of loud and obnoxious, and travelling under sail is altogether more pleasant when the winds permit.

All in all, for being stuck together in what amounts to a 300 square foot apartment for over two weeks (and counting) hasn.t been as catastrophic for me and Ted.s relationship as I might have feared. We.ve landed in our share of arguments, to be sure, but generally we're easy-going enough and rational enough to just settle them and/or move on. A good example of an argument . or maybe .discussion. is a better term . happened this afternoon when we were considering whether or not to take out a reef in the main. The wind was blowing pretty good, but Ted thought we might get a speed boost if we un-reefed, and figured we could handle the extra power since we were heading straight downwind (wing-on-wing). We exchanged points and counter-points for 5 or 10 minutes, but eventually decided to go for it. Voices got raised, tones turned a bit confrontational at times, but the net effect was a reasonable decision and no hurt feelings. I'm incredibly glad we have the sort of relationship capable of such resilience, as I'm certain a trip like this would be utterly impossible without it.

Since I haven.t written in a bit, I didn.t get a chance to log what has probably been the best experience of the voyage thus far, which happened Tuesday evening. It had been a pretty relaxing day (as most of this week has been) and I was free for an afternoon.s. whatever I felt like. Rather than amusing myself with books or music or other entertainment, and rather than immersing myself in writing or talking with Ted, I decided to just spend a little while sitting back and enjoying my rather exceptional circumstances.

With all the planning, learning, preparing, buying, repairing, embarking, and learning more that I've been doing over the past months, I realized that I had lost perspective on this thing that has become my life. Sitting up on the bow, looking across a beautiful stretch of pristine ocean at a picturesque sunset, things suddenly snapped into focus. Many people spend their whole lives dreaming of being able to have such an experience. Even those not excited by the literal prospect of ocean-voyaging can.t help but be stirred by the freedom and independence embodied by such a scene. Seeing things in this light, I couldn.t help but feel grateful, awed, and humbled.

Beyond that, I found myself instilled with renewed motivation. To have been so fortunate as to have realized such a dream at only 26 years old is a gift which I can.t imagine not striving to repay. I don.t like to think of it as obligation; rather, I feel like having been fortunate enough to see how wonderful life can be, I'm compelled to try and bring that joy to others. And so, sitting there watching the dusk.s light fade to yellow and red, I renewed my dedication to two commitments: (1) Always appreciate and be thankful for the life I've had the privilege of living, and (2) When I get back from this trip, more actively seek ways that I can give back to the world.

		<description><![CDATA[It's tough to say exactly where the halfway point of this route is, because we didn.t exactly take a straight-line path, rather curving to the south to get more favorable winds. We can get a decent approximation, though, by measuring our distance from San Francisco and our distance to Honolulu. When they.re equal, we're halfway; and by that definition, we reached the halfway point this afternoon. It was an exciting moment (compared to most of our other moments, anyway). To celebrate, I indulged in my one precious can of sliced pears, which I.d been saving for a special occasion. I think Ted saved his though, I guess preferring to celebrate in some other manner . maybe it was rum.

The occasion prompted us into some reflective conversations on what the trip.s been like so far. Among other things, we found ourselves trying to list out all the little quirks and events that have happened so far. Things like .the time we had a leaking hose,. or .the time the windvane came unlatched.. The list was surprisingly small, considering it's ostensibly a recounting of everything that.s happened to us in the last 16 days.

When you.re out here for this long, funny things start to happen to your perception of time. It's not that it's boring, per se, although it certainly can be that at times. But what I'm talking about is distinct from mere boredom, and more like a Kafka-esque banal repetitiveness. Every day is more or less the same routine: wake up, eat, read, talk, eat again, maybe fix or adjust sails or something, read some more, sleep. There are no real distinctive events to demarcate your memories, so the trip so far just blends into a kind of long tunnel stretching behind you. And there.s nothing specific to look forward to either, other than an expected arrival date, which for us is still at least a week away. It's as though your physical isolation and solitude are metaphorically extended to temporal analogues.

This quality of timelessness is, I think, part of what makes the ocean-passage experience so hard to explain to someone who.s never done it. It's kind of like being in a different world, a different Universe, one in which none of the concerns of daily life in the .real world. matter or even make sense. It is in a sense very primal, reducing you to a creature of eating, drinking, sleeping: surviving, and not much else.

Considering this made me realize that part of the reason I'm so attached to this log, and to writing about the experience in general, is that doing so is a method of staying emotionally connected to the world I left behind. When I write, it's like a little bridge in time, linking me sitting here on this boat in the middle of the ocean to all my friends and family who will read it a few weeks from now when I post it. In a bizarrely symbolic way, writing down my experience is almost like having them here with me, listening to my story.

This little emotional substitution is, I think, pretty important to me. Because I deeply, deeply miss a lot of the people I left behind to take on this voyage, and it.d kill me not to keep some emotional ties to them alive. Guys, if you.re reading this, keep the lamplight burning: I'll be back soon.

		<description><![CDATA[Another couple days, another couple hundred miles. The weather continues to be near-perfect for sailing, with a 20-ish knot breeze blowing pretty much 24/7. We barely touch the sails, maybe making one or two tweaks a day, and those mostly just experiments to optimize our speed or stability. Right now we're trying out something apparently called .jib and jigger,. which consists of dropping the main entirely and sailing under just a jib and a mizzen. In fact, the winds are heavy enough that we've put a reef in the mizzen, and furled the jib to its second reef point, and we're still flying. Over the past 12 hours, we did about 76 nautical miles.

The weather.s favorable nature hasn.t stopped at sailing, either. Today was a beautiful, warm, sunny day, and despite the wind I couldn.t resist some sunbathing. Unfortunately, I may have overindulged a bit, as I earned my first sunburn of the trip. Nothing too bad though, just a classic back-and-shoulders reddening that.ll sting for a day or two and remind me to use sunscreen. I'm looking forward to more tropical sun, and gradually building up the kind of tan that.s notoriously difficult to get in Seattle.

Sailing downwind, at night, in a stiff wind has given me a strange but compelling hallucination (or perhaps .sensory illusion.) several times over the past couple nights. If I concentrate on a fixed object inside the cockpit, e.g. the compass or my laptop screen, then in the dark I can.t see the water going by outside. I can feel the wind, but because the windspeed is significantly greater than our own, the apparent wind is coming from behind us. This results in an astonishingly realistic sensation that the boat is travelling backwards at substantial speed. It's a weird, weird feeling.

The one downside to this weather is that it does make for a kind of rough ride, with the swells gradually building under the steady winds and lengthening fetch. Surfing down the 10- and 12-footers is great fun, but not-so-infrequently they toss a nice splash of water up into the cockpit. In fact, I just got a little spray from one of these all over this laptop, so I think I'm going to end here, and keep our communications link safe.

		<description><![CDATA[We.ve had an interesting weather pattern over the past few days. The winds have still be pretty consistent from the east, but every few hours, a squall comes through. I.d read about these but actually seeing them has been kind of cool. One minute, it.ll be beautifully sunny out, cruising along on a fresh breeze. Then we'll see what looks like a really low cloud, or even just fog, approach us from behind, on the horizon. It gets closer and closer, then suddenly the wind spikes up a good 5+ knots, and it starts raining. Just as we decide we should probably drop some sails to deal with the increased wind, it lets up, and 5 minutes later it's sunny again. This has happened at least five or six times in the last 24 hours.

Other than the squalls, things continue pretty much as usual. The combination of (a) finally starting to feel pretty close to our destination, (b) not having a lot to do during shifts, and (c) having had consistent and predictable winds for a while, all have led to a kind of obsessive-compulsive level of checking our speed, distance remaining, course, and resulting projected ETA. For instance, I can tell you that this afternoon we've averaged about 5.7 knots on a course of about 250* (magnetic). If we maintain that speed, we arrive in Honolulu around Sunday evening, 6 or 7 pm. Conversely, in order to be docked by noon Monday (our tentative self-imposed .goal.) we need to maintain an average speed of 4.7 knots made good.

What can I say: after 20 days at sea with not much to do, this type of arithmetic passes for high entertainment.

Our food situation is both astonishing and amusing. When we did our shopping for this trip, I was certain we had way more food than we'd need, and confident we'd be carrying over a decent bit for the next leg. Now, with at least four days to go, we're rapidly getting down to the bottom of the barrel. All of the foods that we really enjoyed eating are gone or nearly gone. We.re not in much danger of actually going hungry, because we prudently stocked a lot of .filler. foods that are cheap and compact but last a while (e.g. pancake mix). We didn.t really expect to be reduced to eating nothing but pancakes, though, and the fact that it's close is an eye-opener. I guess you don.t realize how much food you eat over the course of 25 days, when not a single bite comes from a restaurant or deli or friend.s kitchen.

The forecast seems to be indicating that the trade winds are going to drop off a bit over the next couple days, maybe as low as 10 knots. We.re hoping this doesn.t come true, because that would make sustaining a 5 knot average pretty tough. To say that we're .anxious. to get to port, at this point, would be a substantial understatement. My craving for steak, pizza, and ground that isn.t rolling or bouncing has reached  a hitherto-unimagined peak. So here.s hoping that the forecasts are wrong. Keep on blowing, winds!

		<description><![CDATA[Well the winds did drop off a bit after all, but fortunately not enough to slow us down more than a bit. Over the past few days we've switched to wing-and-wing using the whisker pole, and in so doing have managed to maintain a little over 5 knots. speed, with a course just about dead set for the eastern tip of Molokai. We.re about 70 miles away from the eastern tip of Maui at the time of this writing, which means by sunrise tomorrow we'll probably be able to see land. That is going to be a very strange and surreal sight.

I've said on many occasions that if we managed to successfully make it to Hawaii, every after that would just be icing on the cake, for me. This is because in many respects, the first two legs (Seattle to SF, and SF to Hawaii) embody the hardest parts of the trip. Aside from obviously being at the low point of me and Ted.s level of sailing knowledge and experience, they each carry their own added challenges. The opening leg was the coldest weather we'll see all year, and quite possibly some of the roughest (unless we're unlucky enough to get caught in a tropical storm). The Hawaii trip, at just over 2200 nautical miles, is the longest single leg on our itinerary.

So suffice it to say, the prospect of waking up tomorrow morning and looking out to the horizon and seeing Hawaiian shoreline drifting past has me pretty excited. I might even go so far as to say that I'm proud of myself. A tiny part of me wants to do a little dance of joy. I think I'll resist the urge though, opting instead for indulging in a deeply relaxing few days of recovery in Honolulu. Then we'll start The Rest of the voyage, and with the initial pressure of proving we're not totally clueless out of the way, I imagine life will become quite idyllic indeed.

Speaking of idyllic, we're coming up on a full moon. Probably tomorrow night, from the looks of it, or maybe the night after. It's hard to describe the experience of an almost-full moon, in a clear sky, on a calm night in the middle of the ocean. .Bright. is definitely part of it; in fact it's bright enough that all the boat.s rigging and sails cast very clear shadows on the deck. But the thousands of tiny specks of reflected moonlight off the surface of the sea . I don.t have the poetic talent to do it justice. Let.s just call it beautiful and leave it at that.

On a mostly unrelated note, I (re-)discovered something about myself: I am a music addict. For no particular reason, I hadn.t really listened to any music for a while, maybe a week or ten days. I guess part of it is that when we had moderate-to-strong winds, I wanted to keep my ears available to catch any sounds indicative of problems (e.g. luffing sails or broken lines). Anyway, last night the weather was pretty light, so I decided to give myself a treat and get some music in, relying on my eyes to catch any problematic situations.

I popped my earbuds in (a reasonably good pair, with the nice soft fittings that block out other noise) and sort of haphazardly threw on a song I.d had in my head that day (Magdalena by A Perfect Circle, I think). When the first few chords hit my eardrums, it was like a dam of raw joy broke and flooded through my body. I could almost feel the dopamine rushing out of dormant glands in my brain. Man, I had forgotten how much I love listening to good music. I proceeded to go through my mp3 player gorging myself on all my favorites for at least an hour, before finally reclaiming my ears for watchkeeping duties. It was a near-spiritual hour though, and reminded me that I'll need to schedule some serious music intake time during our stay in Honolulu.

One more anecdote for tonight. So one of the things we picked up in San Francisco was a little bag of fishing gear: some lures, some line, etc. I'm not much for fish (as those who know me are probably aware), but Ted loves it, and in any case it would be a good supplement to our otherwise-minimal fresh food supply. Unfortunately, due to a combination of factors including laziness, non-ideal weather, and not quite being sure how to turn a live fish on a hook into dinner, we hadn.t even tried to catch anything until today.

But with Hawaii practically in sight, and more importantly with our food supplies down to canned corn and oatmeal (more or less), Ted decided to put out a lure and see what happened. He set the line around 1 or 2 pm, and both of us pretty much forgot about it, not expecting to have any chance of catching anything. Around 3, Ted decided to make himself pasta for dinner. A lot of pasta. Just as he finished eating all he could bear, he noticed the line had a bite!

To our combined shock, there was a fish on the line, flailing around like crazy (as hooked fish tend to do). As Ted brought it in closer we could see it was pretty big, probably 18 inches long, maybe 10-15 pounds (I'm guessing wildly). Sadly, Ted was completely full, and despite my hope to develop a taste for seafood I didn.t think I could eat enough of a fish that big to justify the work of preparing it. And thus, our first fish of the trip .got away.. I think we're going to give it another go tomorrow though; now that we believe catching something is a genuine possibility we might have more patience before resorting to backup dinner plans.

Our current pace should get us in to Honolulu sometime Monday morning. Assuming that holds, I probably won't bother writing here again til we're on land. It's hard to even remember the whole trip, as 23 days kind of blend together into one long scene of boat and ocean. On the whole though, it's been fun, and I'm looking forward to the Marshall Islands.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, this is my 4th time visiting Hawaii, but by far my most stylish entrance. As folks probably saw from the SPOT update, we arrived at Ala Wai Harbor in downtown Honolulu this morning around 5 am. Once I get my feet back under me a bit, I'll send out the ship's log, as well as the more editorial reflections I promised from the Seattle-to-San-Francisco leg. I have a handful of pictures from this trip, too, but it's a little sparse because about a week into the trip I dropped my camera in the bilge, from which it did not recover (sadface). Anyway, all that to come, for now I need a shower and a steak.

Cheers,
Kevin

P.S. I'd love to hear feedback about our various communications - SailMail, SPOT, frequency/content of updates, the Ship's Log, etc. This is (mostly) for you guys, so let me know what you like/dislike. If you get e-mail to me before Friday or so of this week, I can incorporate that feedback into how I do things on the next leg. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey everyone,

First of all, apologies you've all had to read so many of Kev's emails an so few of mine.  Inexcusable, I know.  

My take:

- The first few nights out from SF the dolphins came out to play.  *And* there was phosphorescence.  Incredible combination.  As they swam and jumped through the bow wave they were trailing long tails of light, looking like beautiful underwater comets.  At the risk of sounding sincere, it was actually really awesome and I wish you all could've seen it.  

- Night 4, gale from the south west.  Had to beat into it.  We clocked 40+ knots before the windometer got too clogged with spray to function.  It was a hell of a ride, 15' waves, capped off when the 45lb bow anchor came off it's roller.  I'm not gonna attempt to tell the story of getting it back on board, but suffice to say it took some doing.  Got my ass kicked so hard I was shitting seawater.  

- As expected, the whole "learn to sail" portion of this sail around the world thing turned out to be pretty obvious.

- We are constantly finding random nuts / bolts / cotter pins / etc in the cockpit.  This is pretty disconcerting - what just broke that we don't know about?  And how many more things are breaking but going straight overboard?  I'm really hoping Kev's playing a practical joke on me.  

- Lost count of how many shooting stars I've seen - they're out in force every clear night.  Also lost count of how many times I've banged my head around the boat; what month it is; and how long I've gone without showering.  

- 3 small fish and 1 squid decided to suicide themselves by jumping onto the boat.  The fishy equivalent of jumping off the golden gate.  

- Haha, just found this entry in my journal:  "Speaking of boobs, I haven't seen any for three weeks.  No joke - the Sun Maid raisin cartoon gal in their logo is starting to look pretty hot."  

- (Raise your hand if you just googled the Sun Main raisin girl.  Right??  You see what I'm sayin')

That'll do it!  Majuro here we come.

		<description><![CDATA[Having spent this whole morning packing the $750 of food we bought last night (think we're worried about leaving American food behind?), we're just about ready to head out. This will be my last internet access before we depart, so I look forward to another few weeks of SPOT and SailMail updates to everyone.

FYI, a number of people have asked about our plans for the rest of the trip, so here's our tentative itinerary:

Honolulu, Hawaii to Majuro, Marshall Islands
Marshall Islands to Caroline Islands (somewhere, exact stop TBD)
Caroline Islands to Palau
Palau to Brunei
Brunei to Singapore
Singapore to Sri Lanka (with probably a stop somewhere in Malaysia on the way)

From there, we're thinking we'll head to Oman and then through the Gulf of Aden/Red Sea, up the Suez canal, and then cruise the Med for a while before the Atlantic crossing.

Of course, that's all extremely tentative, and I'll be pretty shocked if we end up doing exactly that route. We'll see though.

And with that, I'm off!

Cheers,
Kevin]]></description>

Wind has been consistent, albeit a bit on the light side. A few extra days' lying in the sun doesn't sound unbearable (even after the bacon's gone).

		<description><![CDATA[Apologies for not writing sooner. We left Honolulu four days ago, but for whatever reason, I just haven.t been in the mood for exposition. I think I was a little mentally overwhelmed by going from total isolation to central modern civilization and back again, and needed to sort of turn my brain off for a while. Anyway I'm feeling much more communicative now, so I'll try to trace back and cover everything I missed.

Also, I should mention that this entry is my first experiment with writing in a physical paper journal instead of using my laptop. This was Ted.s suggestion: aside from saving battery power and being more ocean-elements-resistant, he claims it's more fitting of the whole ocean-sailing ambience. I guess I can see his point(s), so I'm giving it a try. I don.t know if it will have any noticeable effect on the style/content/length of the log; see if you can tell any difference.

Our stop in Honolulu was all-around quite pleasant, and much less stressful than the SF layover. For one, our to-do list was substantially smaller, and Ted managed to take care of most of it in one afternoon. This left lots of time to relax and recuperate in our own ways. For me, that mostly meant going online and catching up on all the Daily Show episodes I.d missed, plus e-mailing all the friends and family who.d sent words of encouragement/congratulations. 25 days of missed Internet takes a long time to review, even in digest form. It's a good thing most of our legs are a lot shorter, because I don.t think I could afford to spend two full days reconnecting to the online world at every stop.

Ted.s dad (.Mr. Phil.) and sister (Megan) made the trip out to Hawaii to visit us, so we took them out for a day-sail on Wednesday (the 4th). We took them out around Diamondhead, and as we cleared the tip of the land, the winds picked up to a good 20+ knots. They got to enjoy a fun ride . I think we topped out around 7.5 knots J

Then Thursday was personal errand day. I had a bunch of minor tasks: laundry, posting pictures, some personal shopping. I also switched my phone to a pay-as-you-go plan, as I wanted to keep my number, but obviously won't be using the phone much. Just another one of those little logistical things that doesn.t even blip on your radar when you first start planning a trip like this, but they add up.

Our Costco trip on Friday was. well, let's just say we may have gone a little overboard. There were two factors contributing to this: (a) We knew we'd come disconcertingly close to running out of food coming from SF, and (b) We knew this was the last Costco on our itinerary, and hence our last chance to buy bulk nonperishable American food. So we stocked up, to the tune of $600, plus another $15 on fresh foods at Safeway. The fact that we somehow managed to cram it all on board still seems sort of miraculous. The good news is, I feel pretty confident that we justified the $50 Costco membership.

Getting underway on Saturday was a little slow, as we had a bunch of little things to take care of and no particular urgency (which is not a bad thing). After refueling, refilling water and propane tanks, pumping out the holding tank, and grabbing one last quick meal on land (which for some unknown reason we both chose tuna sandwiches), we left Ala Wai harbor at about 3:00.

The sailing thus far has been pretty uneventful. We started off with a good strong wind, which died off a bit by Sunday morning, and for most of the last three days we've hovered around four knots. This morning it's picked back up again, and based on the forecast we downloaded yesterday we're expecting to make good mileage for the next 48 hours. We.ll wee. (The relevant milestone for my highly goal-based mind is that in order to reach Majuro in time for a Thanksgiving dinner, we need to average about 110 nautical miles per day, accounting for the IDL.)

Much like the last couple weeks of the trip to Hawaii, passing the time has been pretty ad hoc. We.ve both been reading a lot; just yesterday I finally finished Infinite Jest, which while I enjoyed it, was definitely a slog (people who.ve read it probably know what I mean). Ted.s plowing through Anathem, which I listened to on audiobook last leg, and this has launched us into some particularly nerdy but boredom-averting discussions.

For example, a couple nights ago we spent at least an hour trying to work out a certain geometric proof of the Pythagorean Theorem (of .a2+b2=c2. fame). I'm not sure if we ever got the one Ted was looking for, but we did find two very simple ones, and this was somehow extremely satisfying. It kind of made me pine for my days as a math major, until I remembered how much more I like sleep than homework (the two so often being mutually exclusive in my CMU career).

We also had a lengthy conversation yesterday about quantum mechanics. I won't go into the details because they might spoil certain fun surprises from the book, but it was way out there on the abstract/hypothetical/weird scale. It was the kind of conversation you usually only indulge in when you.re either really really bored or chemically intoxicated. I guess we probably qualify as the former.

Last night.s big excitement was a bird (a pretty big one) that decided to land on our boom (the mainsail.s down) and stay there. As in, really stay there . for over eight hours, not leaving til sunrise. And s/he seemed to show no concern whatsoever for us moving around, pointing flashlights, or getting 6. away to take pictures. (I got some good pictures.) I have to admit, by morning I.d developed a sort of emotional attachment to it, dreams of befriending this animal and taking it along with us as a pet. I was ever so faintly heartbroken when it flew off.

That.s pretty much all I can remember of events so far. We.ve had a couple minor issues with the boat/equipment, but nothing serious or worth describing. The one noteworthy realization I had is that with how warm it is at this latitude, when Ted wakes me up in the middle of the night to help with something, I just stumble out on deck with whatever I'm wearing. Which is usually boxers, and maybe shorts if I was too lazy to take them off before passing out. Point being, when we were up near Seattle (or even somewhat towards SF) going on deck at night meant suiting up: shirt, fleece, windproof pants & jacket, hat, gloves. The convenience of being able to just hop out of bed, take the wheel for 3 minutes, then hop back in is just one of several reasons why sailing should always be done in the tropics.

It's looking like yet another beautiful day, so I'm going to leave this entry at that and start in on my next book. Sometimes, I'm not sure if the routine is keeping me sane or driving me crazy. ;)

		<description><![CDATA[Well, we had fantastic winds for a little while there. From noon Wednesday to noon Thursday, we clocked just over 150 nautical miles, with 84 of them coming in the first half ( a 7 knot average over 12 hours). That.s definitely our best day so far, and what.s more, it was dead on course (the wind having serendipitously shifted to the north).

Unfortunately, it's been steadily subsiding since then. By sunset yesterday (6 pm or so), we were down around 2 knots. Ted finally gave up on sails around 10, and we've been motoring since then. The good news is that we hadn.t used the engine at all yet, so we've still got plenty of fuel to hopefully carry us through this calm. Worst case, we have to wait a day or two for wind . not the end of the world. I've discovered that ocean cruising requires a patient and serene disposition, which I'm working to cultivate.

Via some SailMail exchanges, we've gathered that SPOT isn.t working, apparently because we're out of the coverage area. I'm faintly annoyed, but not terribly surprised, that the SPOT marketing literature claiming worldwide coverage was not completely literal. This circumstance did prompt a lively discussion between me and Ted over the various pros and cons of constant connectivity. I won't get into the details, but we did end up agreeing that if we ever get stranded on a deserted island our first priority is to make a chessboard out of rocks and seaweed. (After a certain amount of time talking with the same person, the hypothetical situations can get pretty out there.)

Its vaguely noteworthy that so far on this leg, nearly 6 days in now, we have still yet to see a ship of any kind since leaving Oahu on the horizon. Even crossing out to Hawaii, I'm not sure we ever went a week with no vessel sightings. I guess the route we're on probably doesn.t go near any/many commercial traffic lanes. We.re paced to pass Johnston Atoll, a U.S. territory, tomorrow, so we'll see if anything pops up near there.

I've been spending a lot of time this night/morning looking at the sky. It's been a particularly clear night, and with light winds and no sails up obscuring the view it's made for some wonderful stargazing. I wish I could identify more of the constellations, because these are pretty much ideal conditions for amateur naked-eye astronomy. Perhaps I'll have to invest some time and energy into learning over the coming months.

I do know a few constellations though. Orion is completely unmissable, even without trying to look for it. The big dipper is also pretty easy, which yields Polaris (the North Star). Spotting this was a bit jarring, as my first thought was, .Wow, that.s a lot lower on the horizon than I remember.. Upon brief reflections, I realized this was of course the case, as we have travelled over 30 degrees south since Seattle. Still, the visual reminder is startling when you.re not thinking about it.

This morning.s moonrise has also been quite stunning. We.re down to a picturesque waning crescent, sitting in that tilted bowl-shaped position that people always hang off the tip of in cartoons. And the sky is so bright and clear that you can easily make out the whole dark half of the orb. I bet you could see it even if it were a new moon; if the weather stays nice we'll find out in a couple days.

Dawn.s starting to pinken the eastern horizon, so I think I'm going to put the pen down and treat myself to another gorgeous ocean sunrise. I have a feeling I'll never get tired of these.

		<description><![CDATA[We spent yesterday completely becalmed, but it was still one of the most fun days I've had so far on the trip. With no wind and the 16* latitude sun, it was already uncomfortably hot by 10 am, so we decided to make lemons (the lack of wind) into lemonade (swimming). We dug out our swim ladder and took turns jumping in.

The water temperature was absolutely perfect: cool enough to be a refreshing break from the blazing sun, but not the slightest bit cold. We usually wouldn.t stay in long, but rather just climb back out, dry off until we were hot again, and repeat. We also decided it would be fun to get some pictures and videos of each other diving off the boat, which provided at least an hour of amusement. Some of them came out pretty good, too . especially the videos, and especially especially when played in reverse.

The wind was basically non-existent, but there were still some good-sized swells (I.d guess 10-12 feet), which made swimming interesting. Watching the boat swing back and forth over the waves from in the water really gave a different perspective. It also made climbing back up the swim ladder surprisingly challenging, because its position relative to the water.s surface would change by 4 to 6 feet on each rock. This gave me a more concrete appreciation for how notoriously difficult it's supposed to be to get yourself (or someone else) back on board the boat in rough seas.

Another startling aspect to the swimming experience was how absurdly clear the water was. This was so remarkable that after we'd stopped for lunch, Ted decided to experimentally test how deep we could see. His methodology was to put a shiny object on the weighted end of a long line, drop it in, and watch how far we could lower it before we couldn.t make it out anymore. In practice, the shiny object was a ball of aluminum foil and the weight was a wrench. He ended up using the entire line, plus a second he added on to it, and we could still make out the wrench/foil. In all, it was over 70 feet of line. The water here is that clear.

On an unrelated note, in my last entry I mentioned feeling like I should get into astronomy. Well last night I was bored and found myself idly glancing through a deck of constellation flash cards someone (I'm not positive who) got Ted as a gift. Within mere minutes I was completely addicted, and spent the next three hours reading and finding stars. I was quite irritated when waves of color emerged on the eastern horizon and started blocking my view. The way it all fits together so elegantly is like a mathematician.s dream . I can.t believe (and am vaguely irritated) that I never discovered this hobby sooner. I'm definitely going to have to look into learning celestial navigation.

The introductory astronomy excursion helped keep my mind off our first fairly significant setback of this leg: our one and only headlamp seems to have died. This may seem like a small problem, and measured by time and money needed to fix it at port it is. But measured by inconvenience in the meantime, it's up there among the worst things that can happen. During night time (which, for those of you not on 24/7 watch schedules, is over 12 hours per day) a headlamp is basically a third hand. It makes everything immensely easier, from adjusting sails to reading or writing to cooking a snack. In hindsight, it was pointlessly stupid of us not to be carrying several spares, and when we get to Majuro we may just stock up with a bunch.

In the meantime we'll make due though; what other choice is there? As long as the weather stays clear I can amuse myself at night with the stars, nature.s original lightless nocturnal entertainment.

		<description><![CDATA[The wind has picked back up again, and it's looking to be a beautiful couple days. sailing. We.re a little bit behind the pace we need to make Majuro for Thanksgiving, but not so much that it's impossible, so I'm hoping for a week of steady 15+ knot trades. Which, as we learned coming to Hawaii, isn.t out of the question.

There are a bunch of milestones that are keeping me occupied right now. For starters, this morning marks exactly two months since we left Seattle. I haven.t made up my mind yet whether the time.s passed blindingly fast or unbearably slowly; it feels like a little of each. Some other milestones include halfway to Majuro (should reach this tonight) and crossing the IDL (about 475 miles).

Another milestone, albeit not exactly a good one, is running out of fresh food, which we've just about hit. We made it eight days though, and during that time ate pretty well, so I'm not complaining. It does mean we can start fishing now; up to this point we didn.t bother because we knew the fresh stuff would go bad if we ate fish instead. So we've got the line in and hopefully something tasty will bite.

My venture into astronomy is coming along, and I can now recognize a good 10-15 constellations. What.s more, I'm starting to really get a feel for the night sky, and how it all fits together and moves over time. I'm really looking forward to continuing to watch it over the rest of the trip, and feel like I could get pretty expert at it by the time I get home. A couple hours a night every (clear) night for most of a year should be enough time to get pretty expert at anything.

This lifestyle sure does give on a lot of time to think. Sure, you do some reading, some talking, you cook, you eat, you even occasionally modify sails. All that occupies maybe 8 or 10 hours a day. You sleep another 8 (if you.re lucky). The rest is just you and your mind, and wherever it wanders.

Beyond that, you have a lot less to really think about than back in the real world. It's not like you lie awake at night dwelling on that project for work, or that idea your friend had, or that cute girl you met. By a couple months into this kind of isolation, you.ve thought everything you can usefully think about every aspect of your life that you can remember.

So now I've started thinking about more abstract stuff: ideas, concepts, philosophies. And imagining things too, about my life, about the future. It's actually very liberating, in a way, to have so few distractions, and to live in (at least an approximation of) a pure thought space. I've had a lot of really good/interesting ideas, or at least ideas that seem really good/interesting to me right now. The only frustrating part is having to wait so long before I can go back home and start acting on them. But I guess if I keep having ideas at this same rate for the rest of the trip, it will have been well worth it.

FYI, we're over 1K nm from the HA SailMail station (and counting), so we *may* have trouble connecting soon. If comms stop, don't fret - we're well on our way to Majuro & things here are peachy. Anyway, it would make ted happy to get "off the grid" for real.

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a comparatively eventful few days. where to begin? Well, let's start with the fish we caught Tuesday morning. As our fresh food had been running out, I.d started putting out the fishing line every morning when the sun came up. We'd already had a couple whole days go by without catching anything, so our hopes weren't especially high, but it takes 30 seconds to drop the line in so why not.

By the time Ted got up, I was feeling pretty sleepy from another boring night.s watch and decided to take a nap. No sooner had I climbed into my bunk than I heard Ted call from the cockpit, .Hey, we've got a fish!. So I climbed back up and lo and behold, there was a bright yellow fish thrashing on the end of the line.

I'm not an expert at fish (meaning I know almost nothing about them) but this seemed like a pretty good-sized specimen. Ted and I estimated him (or her?) at 25 lbs or so, and around 3. from mouth to tail. Getting it up on board took a bit of doing, Ted holding the line in close along the boat while I gaffed the fish and yanked it over the lifelines. Then Ted handled the fun task of cleaning it and cutting some fillets out. There was fish blood everywhere . good times.

There was obviously way too much meat on the thing for us to have any hope of eating all of it, particularly since we've been out of ice for days. So we baked a couple fillets with lemon juice for lunch, and then had a couple more friend with teriyaki sauce for dinner. My appreciation for fish is still very much a work in progress, so I can.t say I loved it, but it wasn.t bad. I can definitely imagine getting to a point where I.d enjoy eating it, so that.s a start.

This week has also been marked by Ted.s adoption of our little magnetic chess set as his primary pastime. You might think this implied that I've been playing him a lot, but in fact that.s only happened twice (both of which he won, albeit that they were extremely close . one pawn differences beginning to end). I'm not that huge of a chess fan so I've declined playing more, resulting in Ted playing .simulated. games against .me. where he tries to guess what I would do. Amusingly enough, I think the simulated me has fared quite well, garnering at least a couple wins. I watched a bit of one game yesterday where I picked him apart. I should take lessons from myself.

We.ve also been dealing with some wind shifts which, although minor, have been enough to prompt us to change our sail plan around for what seems like the first time in a week. For quite a while we were just cruising along on a port tack with the jib and jigger, going whole days without so much as touching the rigging. But yesterday morning I noticed the winds shifting to the northeast, so I (somewhat grudgingly) got on my shoes and gloves and put up the whisker pole to go wing-on-wing. After 20 minutes of that, the wind shifted even more, and I pushed us through to a starboard tack, taking the main back down and re-raising the mizzen. This was more work in an hour than I.d done in three days.

We spent most of the day on the starboard run, but in the evening the wind came back around, and Ted put us back wing-on-wing. Which set the stage for our first real fiasco of this leg (not counting the headlamp), about an hour into my shift this morning. I was in the cabin grabbing something when I heard an unexpected scraping noise. Unexpected scraping noises are almost always a bad sign. I came up and looked forward to find that the whisker pole was rubbing against the shroud, its outward end unsupported and hanging on the lifelines.

A brief investigation revealed that the wire on the end of the pole, to which the topping lift attaches, had snapped clean through. It took me a couple minutes to get the pole detached from the sheets and secured on deck, but then there were two lingering problems: first, the topping lift had flown up out of reach when the wire broke; and second, while I was trying to get the pole under control, the jib had gotten tangled on the furler, and was stuck mostly furled. I didn.t think I could handle these by myself so I woke Ted up (he had also stolen our one good flashlight and hid it somewhere, so waking up up seemed like a fair counter-measure).

We got the pole secured back onto the mast, and then considered our situation. The jib was good and stuck alright, and we couldn.t see an easy way to free it that wouldn.t take a lot of time and effort. On the other hand it was mostly out of harm.s way, and could probably survive being left like that til daylight when it would be immeasurably easier to work on. Similarly the topping lift was going to require going up the mast/shrouds in some form, but it had fortuitously gotten stuck behind the spreader and also seemed safe until morning. We checked our chartplotter and under just the mainsail we were still making almost five knots on more-or-less the right course, so we decided to let things ride for a few hours.

Which brings us to now: the sun.s just risen as I've been writing, and in a few hours when Ted wakes up we'll have a fun day of troubleshooting. With luck, we won't lose much time in the process, as we're currently barely on pace to make Thanksgiving in Majuro. I sure could go for a turkey dinner.

		<description><![CDATA[At our current pace, we'll reach Saturday tomorrow morning. Changing hemispheres is a big milestone - more pears may be in order.

Had some minor adventures this morning when our whisker pole topping lift broke free & the jib got tangled. A few hours & some creative problem-solving fixed things right up though, with hardly any lost time. Still clinging to a chance at T-day in Majuro, if winds hold.

		<description><![CDATA[We.re officially in the Eastern hemisphere! We crossed the International Date Line around 7:15 am Friday morning (in ust-1100 time . so Saturday at 6:15, ust+1200). Looking back on where (and how) we started, it feels sort of amazing, even miraculous, that we've made it this far pretty much on schedule and as planned. We might even be a couple days ahead of my original projections.

In my last entry I mentioned some open issues with the boat. I'm happy to report that we took care of both of them cleanly and quickly, and barely lost any time in the process. The topping lift was stuck between a shroud and spreader only about halfway up the mast, so we were able to rig a pretty safe and easy solution to retrieve it. Ted got on our climbing harness, and then I used the staysail halyard and main winch to hoist him up. He was able to steady himself between two shrouds to keep from flying around too much, and after five minutes of winching I got him up to the loose end of the topping lift. The whole process took less than 15 minutes, and what.s more, we were able to leave the main up and the windvane steering, so we didn.t even slow down our progress.

Untangling the jib was a bit trickier. It had basically gotten wrapped around itself backwards and then seized that way, so pulling the sheets to unfurl it was impossible. Instead, we decided to drop the main and use the motor to drive around in circles, unwrapping the jib using the wind as a lever. It took us a few minutes to realize we needed to slack the sheets, rather than pull them, but eventually it worked and we got it unfurled. There were no signs of any lasting damage, which was a huge relief. By 10:30 am we were back under way, good as new.

Since Thursday night, we've been getting an excellent tutorial in squalls. These are a fun little weather phenomenon that I don.t think I've written about yet. The brief description you get from sailing books (or Wikipedia) is usually something like .a brief and sudden burst of rain, often accompanied by strong gusts of wind.. This is so blandly accurate that it belies the real experience of sailing through one on the open ocean.

We.ve been getting little squalls for weeks now; just about since we got into the tropics. Our typical experience went something like this. We'd be sailing along at a nice clip on a beautiful sunny day. We'd glance back at the horizon behind us and notice a small but menacing dark cloud, with what looked like fog below it extending down to the water.s surface. A few minutes later we'd get a sudden kick of wind . not huge but definitely noticeable, maybe 3-5 knots . followed shortly thereafter by a few drops of rain. This was our cue that we had about a minute or two before the squall-proper hit, so we should double-check the sails and head below (unless we wanted a shower). When the rain came it would vary between a spattering and a steady downpour but usually only last for 5-10 minutes, something less. Next thing you know it's bright and sunny again, with the menacing cloud continuing forward ahead of you. If you looked around as soon as the sun was back out, your odds of spotting a rainbow were worth betting on.

This squall experience had become so commonplace (averaging one or two a day) that I.d kind of stopped noticing. Until my watch shift Friday morning. It started like other squalls, only because it was night I didn.t see the cloud (just noticed some missing stars). But when the puff hit it was stronger than any previous squall I.d remembered, and when the rain came it was absolutely torrential. It was the kind of rain where before you can even contemplate going inside you.re soaked head to toe. Not that I could have gone inside anyway, as it took me 15 minutes just to reef the sails enough that I could control the boat. This particular squall.s other main charm was that it lasted a good 45 minutes, by the end of which my fingers were past raisiny and into deflated-punching-bag territory.

During the day Saturday (we skipped Friday, remember) we had more squalls, all generally lasting longer and bringing heavier weather than what we'd been used to. This culminated in a beauty in the afternoon that we got some great photo/video footage of. The saving grace that makes these tolerable is that it's so warm out that the rain feels good, and if you just relax and run with it it can be kind of fun. Especially after a week+ of being uncomfortably hot all the time.

Today seems to have descended into an on-and-off drizzle, though, and the rain.s beginning to shed its novelty. At this point I.d be OK with some sunshine and a steady breeze to take us the last 440 miles to Majuro.

		<description><![CDATA[Apparently, for reasons unknown, birds love just hanging out on our boat. They seem to just appear out of nowhere, hundreds of miles from any land, and pop in to say hello. They.ll pick a nice-looking perch, say the boom or the stern pulpit, and just sit there for hours. Several times we've had avian guests through the whole night. This morning at one point there were three on board, with a fourth flying around but unable to find space. I have no explanation for this behavior; it's not like Ted and I are feeding them (in fact we've tried to give them crackers, and they seem wholly uninterested). It's kind of fun though, and other than the bird crap all over our boat it's harmless.

In totally unrelated news, it's occurred to me that tomorrow is my 26-and-two-thirds birthday. Thus, in a strict technical sense (and does any other sense matter?) I will be leaving my mid-twenties and entering my late-twenties. It seems important to subdivide my life like this, or I won't be able to remember anything about it 20 years from now. The mid-twenties were a lot of fun . I'm sorry to see them go. Late-twenties has all sorts of connotations of .settling down. and .responsibility. which I'm altogether uncomfortable with. Maybe I can be one of those people who acts like a crazy, idealistic, ambitious twenty-two year-old until I'm fifty. I guess given where I am starting off this last third of a decade isn.t a bad start down that path.

My quarter-life crisis aside, the sailing portion of the trip is going well. We.re a little over 200 nm from Majuro now, and still have over 3/4ths of a tank of fuel, so our chances of making it in on Thursday are looking good. My milestone-counting has noted that we are now west of Fiji, and making a good bid on passing Auckland.s meridian in the next few hours. Also, we're now far enough along on our voyage that even at the furthest-out zoom level on our chartplotter (which shows Taiwan, Japan, and much of Australia) the U.S. isn.t visible. The evidence is beginning to mount that we have, in fact, travelled quite a respectable distance since our departure in September.

Another, vaguely unfortunate, sign of how far we've gone from civilization is that we're apparently out of all communication range, at least given our equipment. We got out of SPOT coverage a while ago, and although we still try sending an update daily, I'm assuming none of them get through. Until four days ago SailMail was fine, but it seems that about 1500 nm is the limit of our transmission power, as the last few days we've been unable to connect. Fortunately our access to weather data isn.t dependent on either of these platforms, and using radiofax we've still been able to get regular surface analyses and forecasts.

The lack of connectivity is a little frustrating for me, but the good news is that we're pretty much done with the .wide open stretches of empty water. portion of the trip, at least for a while. For the next couple months we'll almost always be within a few days of land of some sort. We will also be heading back towards civilization soon, and will gradually pick back up comms capacities through the Caroline Islands and towards Palau. I'm really looking forward to this next stage of the trip, as it promises to be a little less monotonous and more exciting. Not to complain, but after a few thousand miles of staring at empty ocean, some variety sounds pretty good.

We've been warmly welcomed by the local yacht club (who graciously even invited us to their Thanksgiving potluck this afternoon), as well as the US Ambassador (story to follow for those not "in the know").

Off to get some much-anticipated Turkey, more stuff coming over the next few days.

		<description><![CDATA[Our stay in Majuro has been lovely. We.ve been warmly welcomed by a variety of communities (more on that below), which has made it much easier to get our bearings on the island. As our first stop outside the U.S., the Marshall Islands have been a very interesting view of a different culture and lifestyle. The international travel element of this trip has never been the primary draw for me, but it's definitely a fun side-benefit, and I'm looking forward to seeing more places over the coming months.

Before getting into Majuro though, I should run through the last few days of the passage. As Tuesday wore on, the winds started giving out, and our speed under sail gradually dropped below 5 knots, then below 4. We knew that to make Thanksgiving dinner, we probably needed to be at the entrance to the Majuro lagoon by sunrise Thursday, as it's another three hours from there to the mooring area, plus some unknown amount of time to clear customs and immigration. Working out the math on our remaining distance, we had to average at least 4.5 knots to make it.

We stayed under sail as much as we could, hoping the winds would pick up. Our diesel tank was still mostly full, and by our best estimates of our fuel consumption we had enough to motor most of the remaining distance, but whether or not we could go the whole way was tight, so we tried to keep churning out miles under wind power. Eventually, though, our speed was under 3 knots, and we started motoring.

Through all of Wednesday the wind stayed light, so we ended up motoring through pretty much the entire day, and into Thursday morning. Fortunately, our fuel economy seemed to be a bit better than we'd thought, and we made it to the Calalin channel (at the north end of Majuro Atoll) with plenty still in the tank. As the sun rose over the eastern part of the island, and with Ted sleeping down below, I took us in towards the Uliga dock where we were to clear customs. We got there around 9 am.

Our warm reception by the local yacht club started before we'd even stopped moving. As we approached the mooring buoys, we were hailed on VHF radio, and directed to tie off to a buoy that was apparently going to be available. Next thing we knew, a flurry of radio traffic between several of the yachts there was coordinating with us to get customs to come out and clear our boat. Meanwhile, somebody dropped by in a dinghy with a welcome package of information, including an extremely detailed guide to the island designed for yachties (this came in extremely handy). We were also generously invited to the Thanksgiving dinner the yacht club was holding that afternoon. It was a pot luck, but they said they.d excuse us from bringing a dish, seeing as we just came in.

For the sake of posterity, I should explicitly thank Dave and Ronda on Swan, Bonnie on Moonbird, and John on Hawkeye for all their help getting us settled in.

We eventually managed to get in touch with a Marshellese customs agent, and using our dinghy (for the first time since Seattle) I went ashore, picked him up, and brought him out to the boat. After a brief inspection we were cleared, and ready to go ashore. Our next task was to try and find the U.S. Ambassador. Oh, I guess I should explain that part of the story.

Back in the late summer, as we were planning our route, my mother mentioned to me that her friend (and my childhood neighbor) Jane had a sister-in-law who had just been appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the Marshall Islands. She said that if we ended up going through there, we should let her know, so we could benefit from some local knowledge. This was a pretty compelling reason to try and make our route go through there, but as we planned the trip, it was clear the Majuro was a natural stop anyway.

So while we were in Hawaii, I got in touch (through Jane) with Ambassador Martha (.Marti.) Campbell, who very graciously invited us to stay with her at the official Ambassador.s residence during our stopover in Majuro. And that.s how it came to pass that as we came ashore after clearing customs, we were greeted by an Ambassador. Sometimes, luck just smiles on you, and that.s no bad thing.

Thursday evening we had two huge Thanksgiving dinners, one with the yacht club, followed by a second with the staff at the U.S. embassy. Piling in turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes and all the other Thanksgiving delights made all the motoring worth it: if we'd gotten in even 6 or 8 hours later we probably wouldn.t have made it. The first night back on land after a passage is always a good one, but that night I slept especially contentedly and well.

Since then we've been following our usual on-shore routine, with a mix of relaxing, working on a small but not-insignificant to-do list, and seeing the sights of the island. The facilities here haven.t been bad, and between the two hardware stores we've managed to get almost everything we needed. Internet connections are a little hard to come by, and very slow when you find them, but fortunately Marti has let us use her computer which is on a special embassy connection that gets decent speeds.

The island itself is a fascinating place. The geography is pretty bizarre, as you would expect for a place with a total land area of 3.75 square miles, but where it is frequently 10-15 miles between points of interest. The whole thing is a very thin ring around the lagoon, which is an oval about 20 miles wide by 10 miles high. And when I say it's thin, I mean really thin. At the widest parts it may be as much as 3/4 of a mile, but for some stretches it's a mere couple hundred yards.

There.s a road on the island. It's pretty much the only road. On the wider areas there are a few loops off the main road, but none of these connect to anything but the main road, so for all intents and purposes there.s basically one road. Partially as a result of this, the taxi system here works more like buses in the U.S.: you stand on the side of the road in the direction you want to go. When a taxi goes by you flag it down, and if they have room they.ll stop to let you in. You should not expect to be the only passenger, and other people may get in after you. The driver doesn.t (usually) ask you where you.re going; instead, when you get to the place you want to get out, you just ask him to stop, then pay him $.50 ($1 for longer trips).

While this system took a little getting used to, it seems to work pretty well, and getting around the island is surprisingly easy. Ted and I went out on Saturday night to check out the nightlife, and visited three or four places (all separated by taxi rides) without much trouble. Of the places we went, most seemed pretty quiet, but we ended up at a bar called Flame Tree that had pool tables and karaoke, and could more or less have passed for a dive bar in the states.

We.re approaching the end of our stay now though. Our plan is to try and leave tomorrow morning, pending finishing up everything we need to do, and also checking the long-term weather for the passage. We decided to stay through Wednesday in order to catch the Patriots game this afternoon, since it's pretty unusual for us to have any chance of seeing their games, and this one should be good. We spent yesterday afternoon refueling (shuttling 10 gallons at a time in our dinghy), and will need to restock on food tomorrow, but hopefully we can get everything done.

The next leg should be a pretty quick one, as we're planning our next stop at Kolonia, Pohnpei. The trip.s only about 700 nm, so with good winds we'll make it in under a week. With luck, we'll be eating mostly fresh foods the whole way, which will make it an altogether more pleasant experience. Kolonia.s even smaller than Majuro though, with a population around 10,000, so it will be interesting to see what it's like there. At any rate, we won't have an Ambassador hosting us, which in and of itself will make life trickier. (Thanks again for all your hospitality, Marti!)

		<description><![CDATA[Ted and I have had a lovely stay here in Majuro, but the time has come to head back out onto the high seas. We're just about prepped for departure, and after a bit of food-shopping this afternoon we're planning to set sail. Our next planned port is Kolonia in Pohnpei, which (with cooperative weather) should take us 6-7 days.

We'll keep trying SPOT and SailMail, but as we've seen, coverage in this region is a bit sparse. Similarly, finding usable internet connections in Pohnpei may be hard (especially without an Ambassador hosting us), so I apologize in advance if our communications are minimal. As always we'll do our best to stay in touch, but no promises.

Finally, I got a good suggestion from a friend of mine: taking Q&A. So if you want to ask us any questions, send them my way! We'll collect them at Kolonia, and post answers back at the next stop.

Cheers,
Kevin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a pretty uneventful trip so far. We are definitely feeling the effects of moving south of the trades, and while the wind has been consistent, it has been light. I.d guess it's mostly been in the 10-12 knot range, maybe falling to 8 at times, and as a result we've been meandering along at a casual 4 knots, give or take. We.ve briefly considered motoring once or twice, when the wind has gone especially quiet, but decided not to ruin the overwhelmingly pleasant conditions.

The nice thing (well, one of many) about this comparatively short leg is that we don.t have to care nearly as much about our speed. With a total distance of less than 800 miles and no deadline in particular, we can take 7 days, 8, 9, 10, whatever. So if the weather.s nice and we're doing 3 knots and want to just relax and enjoy ourselves, then that.s what we'll do.

And the weather has, indeed, been nice. Aside from one or two very brief squalls the first night, we haven.t been getting rained on at all, which is a little surprising given how much precipitation we saw in Majuro. Instead, we've had beautiful sunshine and calm seas, so while the ride.s been slow it's been fairly idyllic. As we're trying to head more or less downwind, and the wind has been shifting a bit here and there, we've been doing a bit of jibing; otherwise the boat.s been taking care of herself.

At this point the novelty of life at sea is beginning to wear off, and I'm gradually getting a feel for what the cruising lifestyle is really like. By and large, I have to say I can see the appeal. It is, in many respects, an almost uniquely carefree and uncluttered life. I don.t think that I'll be tempted to keep doing it when this planned journey reaches its conclusion, though. There are still far too many things I want to do with my life that distinctly require being on land (or at the very least are much easier that way. But maybe one day, if I'm lucky enough to retire with some spare capital, and find a woman keen on a wandering life at sea, I'll give it another whirl.

As a note to my future self, though, in the event that I decide to return to sea and am reading this log in preparation: Whatever you do, stay in the tropics. You.ll thank me. or I'll thank me. or something.

The only real noteworthy event since we left Majuro on Wednesday is the fish we caught last night. We'd had two lines in pretty much nonstop since Thursday morning, but it wasn.t until Ted added a second lure to one of them that we got a bite (though this was probably just coincidence). In any case, around 10:30 last night I noticed one of the lines was taught, so I pulled it up alongside the starboard railing and gaffed it onto the deck. It was during this process that I discovered an important lesson: don.t run two lines at once. The fish, presumably struggling against the hook, had gotten completely tangled in the other line. After I killed it (and left cleaning it for Ted), I spent a full hour untangling the lines. In the end it was worth it though, as we had fish for dinner today and still have a few fillets in the icebox.

Other than that, things are pretty quiet, as usual. Having switched night shifts again, I'm back to the first watch. In addition to being much easier on my circadian rhythms, this has the benefit of changing up which portion of the night sky I get to see. I've already learned several new constellations that were always below the horizon by the time I woke up last leg. And it's a lovely night out, so I'm going back to enjoying it.

		<description><![CDATA[A slight but noticeable increase in the wind has helped us pick up a speed a bit, and it's now looking like we have a decent chance of making Pohnpei by Thursday. We averaged close to 5 knots over the last 24 hours, and are now only about 275 nm away. This is a welcome relief from what we'd seen through the first half of the trip, during which a sub-4-knot pace was making a Friday morning arrival seem optimistic.

Of course ultimately one day doesn.t matter that much, but I'm slightly more anxious about our timeline since reviewing it this weekend. Following our projected course and estimated speed all the way through to the Mediterranean, we don.t have all that much leeway if we hope to make the Atlantic crossing before hurricane season. We do have the benefit of having very flexible plans, so deciding to just stop in the Med is a viable option, should we be late getting there. Still, any opportunity we have to gain a day on the schedule is a good thing.

Even with the fresher breeze the weather is still near-perfect. With hardly any swells to speak of, the waves are minimal, and the ride.s smooth and quiet. I remarked to Ted that now I actually have to make an effort not to make noise in the cabin while he.s sleeping; usually the ambient sounds of the wind, sea, and boat easily drown out a pot clanking.

Annoyingly enough, though, the lovely tropical weather doesn.t seem to have stopped my seemingly annual late-November/early-December head cold. Over the last few days I've come down with a lovely little runny nose, combined with all the various associated charms. I had wondered, before this whole trip started, what it would be like being sick at sea. Well now I can confirm that it's pretty much the same as being sick on land: crappy. Both the advantage and disadvantage of this version is the very slow lifestyle. On the one hand, it's easy to get rest, as that.s more or less all I do all day anyway. On the other hand, this really gives me a lot of undistracted time to fully appreciate and savor the experience.

Oh, in unrelated news, I forgot to mention in my last entry that we saw a ship on Saturday afternoon. It was a mid-size commercial vessel of some sort (I have no idea what exactly), maybe 5 nm off our port side. This is worth noting because, other than when we were in sight of Majuro, it was the first (and still only) other boat we've seen since leaving Hawaii. It seems that this part of the Pacific Ocean really is pretty isolated. It will be interesting to see how our frequency of sightings increases as we near Asia, even if it's a highly non-statistically-significant sample.

Meanwhile, we still have a few thousand miles to go before reaching .civilization,. so I've been thinking through our next month or so. After Pohnpei (which we hope to limit to a relatively brief stop, for afore-mentioned reasons) I had been assuming we'd go straight for Palau, a 1400 nm trip. At Ted.s suggestion this afternoon, though, I took a look on our chartplotter for possible stops in between. It turns out there are several promising candidates in the islands of Yap, the western-most state in the Federated States of Micronesia. Stopping at one (or more) of these would really help break up the trip, even if only to restock on ice and fresh food. We.ll have to investigate more in Kolonia (which, as the capital and largest city of the FSM, should have good cruising info).

Taking this into account, the most likely scenario is that we'll arrive in Palau sometime between Christmas and New Year's. So it's shaping up like we'll celebrate NYE in Koror, with all 10,000 of its inhabitants. If things do indeed turn out that way, it promises to be quite a novel experience.

		<description><![CDATA[Two unrelated factors have combined to become a source of moderate annoyance for me on this trip. The first is, as I've previously mentioned, Ted and I switched shifts again, so I'm now on the first watch and sleep in the morning (1 am to 9 am, give or take). The second is that unlike our last couple legs, which were predominantly southwest, this passage is almost due west. It may not immediately be obvious why this poses a problem, until you think about sunrise, and consider that the berth I sleep in is right in line with the companionway (the entrance to the cabin). The result is that around 7 am I get the full illuminating force of the tropical sun right on my peacefully resting eyelids.

After a couple days of being unceremoniously and unpleasantly awakened by this event, I asked Ted to drape a towel or something across the opening when the sun starts coming up. Fortunately, this has improved the situation dramatically. Still, I thought I would share it, as an interesting anecdote of the sort of unexpected little nuisances of life at sea.

Meanwhile, the winds have stayed quite cooperative, and we're in good shape to get in to Pohnpei tomorrow morning, having less than a hundred miles to go. We even got a nice shift in wind direction last night, which has let us put off jibing. If the current course holds it will take us just about straight to Pohnpei. It's worth noting, as we near the end of this leg, that we haven.t once so much as started the engine since pulling off our buoy in Majuro. This is a credit to both the (reasonably) steady winds and, more remarkably, our solar panels, which have done a surprisingly effective job at keeping our batties topped off.

Arrival in Pohnpei ought to be interesting. Majuro was our first stop outside the U.S., and there we were expected and welcomed by both the yacht club and the Ambassador, all of whom were very helpful. Sailing in to Kolonia will be a little different: all we have is a chart and a radio. Trying to figure out exactly where to go and what to do, even just to clear customs, could prove trickier than one might think (bear in mind the total population of Kolonia is around 10,000, and they don.t exactly have foreign yachts passing through daily). But I guess it's good practice for later stops along our itinerary; at least here they speak English, use the dollar, and accept U.S. passports with no visa.

We caught another fish yesterday. We grilled up some fillets. They were tasty. This is starting to become commonplace, so I'll probably stop mentioning it, unless it's an interesting fish or I really have nothing else to say. I am happy to report, though, that I'm definitely developing more of a taste for it. I may yet become a seafood convert.

Assuming we do reach Kolonia tomorrow, it will probably be a busy couple days of restocking and sightseeing, and I doubt I'll get much time for writing. So my next entry will most likely be once we're back on the water, headed for Yap. Until then, cheers!

		<description><![CDATA[Trip here:  easy breezy beautiful. 

A few quick notes on Pohnpei:

- Our GPS/chartplotter is not even remotely accurate in the harbor here, and the harbor channel and anchorage is a ridiculous maze of unmarked coral.  That led to some fun circumstances, whereby twice we had me at lookout in the bow, Kevin steering us forward at barely a knot, and me yelling Back!  BACK!!!  as coral heads came out of nowhere.  Two or three *very* near-groundings.  The overcast sky cast grey light across the water so we couldn't see through it to the coral until almost on top of it.  I was delerious from the combination of land, fresh meat, and post-adrenaline for most of last night.

- The dinghy dock at our anchorage has a 5'-10' section of wooden planking with well under half of the planks actually still in place. 

- Some serious rainforest here.  If you make it off the dock alive, the forest's got the look of the kind of place you could wander into to take a leak and never be seen or heard from again until your teeth are identified in the stomach of some new species of lizard 20 years later.

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like SPOT hasn't been getting through. Well, I'm happy to report that we arrived safely in Pohnpei Thursday morning (bear in mind date-line conversion). It took a while to get through various customs/immigration red tape (we had to give a crew list to no less than five different agencies), but we finally anchored in the late afternoon, and have since been enjoying Kolonia. It's an interesting place.

Since this was a short trip I only made a few log entries, but I'm including them below, figured I might as well.

		<description><![CDATA[We're finally ready to leave Pohnpei, though we've had a great time here. Our next "real" stop is Palau, but we are tentatively planning on stopping at one of the small outlying islands of Yap on the way (possibly Lamotrek - note that it doesn't have a wikipedia entry ).

We hope to pick back up reception for SPOT and SailMail somewhere between here and Palau. I look forward to being back in touch.

		<description><![CDATA[We spent five days ashore in Honolulu, six and a half in Majuro, and nine in Pohnpei. For the sake of our schedule, I'm hoping the trend doesn't continue. That said, I have no regrets whatsoever about our extended stay in Micronesia: we had a great time and I suspect when all's said and done I will remember it as one of the highlights of the trip.

Our arrival on the morning of Thursday the 10th was as much of an adventure as I'd expected. Making our way through the reef surrounding the island was tricky, as the passage we went through was minimally marked. At one point we switched course at the last minute because we saw a motor boat come out to the right of a lighthouse that we had been aiming to pass on the left. Once we made it to the dock, we had to clear in with five different agencies (port control, quarantine, customs, immigration, and EPA), all of whom wanted a printed copy of our crew list. Hooray for bureaucracy.

After finally getting cleared in, a process that totaled over five hours, we left the commercial dock for the anchorage. This, too, was an exciting half-mile trip, as the channel inland was not only poorly marked but very deceptive. Rather than across the middle of the harbor, as one might expect, it curved way around the outside edge. The middle was occupied by very shallow reef, and on two separate occasions we very nearly ran into the coral before Ted spotted it and frantically yelled at me to reverse. Nothing gets your adrenaline pumping quite like trying to "slam on the brakes" in an 18,000 pound floating projectile. (And by the way, the GPS was no help at all - at several points while we were in the proper channel it showed us as on land.)

Once we made it to the anchorage, we had the fun test of dropping anchor for the first time this trip. Prior to Pohnpei, I had used an anchor three times ever, and only once in Kallisti. Ted had never done it at all. It's always festive doing things for the first time which, if you screw up, have severe and embarrassing consequences. Especially when there's an audience, which is somehow always the case. But thankfully after a couple tries we got the anchor set fine, and had no problems with it for the rest of our stay.

Our first night ashore was, for me, one of the most memorable parts of the trip. This wasn't because we saw or did anything all that exciting; on the contrary it was pretty quiet and uneventful. What was memorable was the sense of totally unprepared, unbriefed exploration. Going in, we knew little more about Kolonia than was in the Wikipedia article, which is to say not much. I found the mystery of it seductively alluring (probably enhanced by the nighttime darkness), while simultaneously the immediacy of actually being there was excitingly surreal.

I remember my first impression of Kolonia that night as being that, if you didn't talk to the locals and squinted a little, you could believe you were in a small town in the southeastern U.S. The dozen or so roads were all single lane, with no traffic lights and only a couple stop signs. They were lined by many small homes, often with families sitting casually on the porch, and dogs that looked like strays lounged everywhere. Also, Christmas lights were strung up everywhere: apparently the Pohnpeians are really into Christmas. Seeing all those lights while enjoying the balmy 80 degree evening was a strange juxtaposition indeed.

As the next few days wore on, we got to see more of the local scenery and culture. There were, to be sure, some notable differences. For one, the small roads were full of little roadside stands every couple hundred yards, stocked like small convenience stores: candy bars, chips, sodas. Even when we drove outside Kolonia and around the island, these little shops were common. Also, as in Majuro, the cabs were shared by multiple passengers, and had a fixed rate ( in town).

Some similarities were striking, though. On our second day we got burgers at Angie's, the closest thing on the island to fast food (there were no chains). While we were eating I heard a cell phone ring and turned to see a girl around 14 years old answer it. I didn't even have a cell phone at that age, as a tech-savvy middle class American! That was only 12 years ago, so with a bit of anthropological hand-waving, I claim that Pohnpei is less than 12 years behind the U.S., technologically speaking.

In general as we moved about in Pohnpeian society, I couldn't help but feel a certain degree of kinship and shared destiny with its (and all) people. Watching children walking home from their schools, I found myself thinking, "With the right opportunities, one of them may someday cure cancer." This to me is one of the greatest benefits of travel: a recognition and reminder that in most respects the people of the world share the same hopes, aspirations, fears, and challenges, and that our fates are inextricably intertwined.

My interactions with the local populace wasn't just limited to observation. On our second night we went out to a bar where we started playing pool with a couple local guys, who introduced themselves as Sammy and Samuel. After they kicked our ass in back-to-back games we put the cues down and started talking with them and their cousin Michael. They were cool, ordinary guys, and after we'd chatted for a while, they asked us if we'd seen the ruins at Nan Madol yet. We had heard about them, and had them strongly recommended, but hadn't made it there yet. Right there on the spot they graciously offered to drive us there (about an hour away, almost the opposite side of the island) and give us the tour. How's that for local hospitality?

Our trip to Nan Madol with Michael and Samuel was another memorable part of Pohnpei for me. The ruins were indeed pretty cool, but what I really enjoyed was the spontaneity of spending a day with a couple total strangers, halfway around the world from where I grew up. And the best part was that they were pretty much normal guys just like us. Well, in personality anyway - it turned out that Michael had just been elected Mayor of Sokehs, one of the municipalities on the island. Which means that so far this trip we've been hosted by both an Ambassador and a Mayor. (As an aside, we also briefly ran into Pohnpei's Governor one night at a bar; it's a small island.) I'm hoping to add to that list before we're done - maybe the Sultan of Brunei has a sailing hobby.

All the experiences with locals were great, but we also met some pretty cool fellow travelers and expats. There were too many to really tell all their stories in enough detail to do them justice, so I'll just briefly list a few:

-James and Emily aboard Corsair (I may have misremembered the boat name): A great couple from the Midwest who set sail from Australia a few months back. They're heading towards Japan, where they plan to teach English while exploring Japanese culture.

-Captain Ron and the crew of Shalimar II: An absolutely gorgeous catamaran owned by a couple from Vanuatu. They hired a captain (yes, his name really is Ron, and yes he goes by "Captain Ron") to take them cruising. Ron was a fantastically extroverted and vivacious old mariner with tons of sailing experience and a ridiculously infectious smile. He was kind enough to help us troubleshoot our outboard motor, plus give us tons of other little tips and advice.

-Ken and Katie on Sand Dollar: Fellow ketch sailors, they were anchored next to us, and like us played the departure delaying game like professionals. They'd originally planned to leave Wednesday but when we pulled out on Saturday they hadn't budged. Ken was also heralded as the resident weather guru and graciously gave me some pointers.

-Ty, Tyler, Amber, and Kiran: Some awesome Americans who were living on the island, for various professional reasons or no reason at all. Ty was a great host and social network hub, introducing us to the others. Tyler and Amber were World Teach and Peace Corps respectively, and had lots to share about Pohnpei and its people. Kiran was just one of the craziest and coolest guys I've ever met, and he wants to come join us for a passage somewhere in the Mediterranean. We'll see if we can work it out.

-Jakob and John: Two Norwegians who are experienced ocean sailors, and who were waiting in Pohnpei to meet up with their friends and boat before starting three months of cruising. I got to talk to them a lot about cruising, and greatly enjoyed the kinship of sharing in that experience.

We had some good times with these people, and truth be told it was their company more than anything else that kept us in Pohnpei twice as long as we'd planned.

Eventually we did manage to leave though, pulled onwards by the knowledge that equally interesting people and places are waiting for us to the west. On Friday the 18th we stocked up on food and ice, hoisted the anchor, and headed for the commercial dock to check out. This led to the unfortunate sour ending that left a bad taste in our mouths after an otherwise excellent visit.

We got to the dock around 1:30 pm and radioed Port Control to tell them we were leaving. They said they would contact customs and immigration, and we should just wait there. A little while later Port Control came by to clear us, and Customs not long thereafter. Then we waited for immigration. And waited. Numerous attempts were made to contact them, and we were repeatedly assured that they were "on their way." Finally they came around 6:30 - when it was already too dark to safely navigate the channel out.

We were allowed to stay at the dock overnight, and cleared out first thing Saturday morning. In all it was only really a half-day delay on top of a four day voluntary extension to our stay, so objectively it wasn't a big deal, but it was still frustrating. Why does bureaucracy always have to rain on sunny days? Ah well, that's just life I guess.

At any rate, we got under way yesterday and have been making decent time. Speaking of rain though, it's been a wet passage thus far, with a near-constant drizzle and no break in the clouds. The winds have been weird too, as all day today we've been close-hauled into a wind almost dead out of the west. We've had to get reacquainted with upwind sailing, and its accompanying 15-20 degree heel. Tonight we might even tack, for what could be the first time since Hawaii. I may need to review how to do it.

Looking forward, our route to Palau promises to be a little more engaging than the last couple. There are at least five or six little islands or atolls that we'll pass near, and we plan to stop at one or two to check them out. Many of these outlying islands have populations in the hundreds and land areas in fractions of square miles, so I imagine they'll be a pretty unique experience. We have another 550 miles or so to our first projected stopover, so until then, it's back to the cruising routine.

		<description><![CDATA[The wind stayed obstinately out of the west all through Monday. On top of that, as we drew further south on the starboard tack, we began to suspect (based on our GPS-calculated speed-over-ground) that we were fighting a current. A brief experiment of reversing our course while under engine power revealed over 2 knots' difference between our ESE speed and our WNW speed. Some of this is wind and waves, but it still pointed to a rather nasty countercurrent. So we kept the engine on for a while, heading NW to try and clear the current's path.

Late last night it seemed to gradually pay off, as our speed picked up bit by bit. I think we're mostly out of the current now. Unfortunately, the wind has dropped again, and we're crawling our way WNW on a weak SSE breeze. Such is the nature of sailing, I suppose. We'll just have to wait patiently and hope a steady NE or E trade finds its way here.

Given the weather, today was another relaxing but boring passage of the sun through the sky. These calm days are especially quiet on board, and they seem to crawl by, lasting far longer than the hours the clock records. This is particularly true downwind, when there's hardly any rocking or heeling, and one can almost imagine oneself in a meadow in a forest. Only the gentle bobbing and soft lapping of the water shatter the illusion.

I've discovered a wonderful distraction on these days. Because it gets so unbearably hot in this weather, with little wind to counteract the sun's baking rays, keeping cool is a constant aspiration. What I've found is that if I drape my feet way down over the lee (downwind) railing, I can dip them in the water each time the boat rocks to that side. The feeling of the cool water rushing through my toes and around my ankles does almost as much to fight the heat as a cold drink. If you're reading this and you're sailing in the tropics (or thinking about doing it someday), remember to give this a try. It's a wonderful sensation.

Speaking of wonderful, or at least interesting, sensations, I forgot to mention Sakau in my entry about Pohnpei. Sakau is a plant whose roots the locals grind up and mix with water to make an intoxicating beverage. If you've heard of Kava, it's the same thing just with a different name. It's huge in Pohnpei, and Sakau markets are all over the island. There are traditions and customs around the making and the drinking of Sakau that are hundreds (maybe thousands?) of years old.

One of the nights of our extended say, some of the Americans we'd met took us out to have Sakau. It was a pretty unique and fun experience. Once you get over drinking something that looks and more or less tastes like mud, you start to feel the effects after a few solid draughts at the coconuts it's served in. At first this manifests as a mild tingling and a gradual sensation of getting heavier and lazier. As the coconuts keep coming around, you reach a state of deep relaxation. It's not a particularly euphoric feeling, just a serene calm. The scene of a Sakau market as the evening wears on is possibly one of the most amusing (and, in a way, enlightening) things I've seen this trip: a diverse crowd of people just peacefully and happily existing together.

Come to think of it, drinking Sakau is kind of like sailing in calm weather. There's not a lot going on, but somehow, everything seems alright. Whatever problems there may be can wait. And in that spirit, I'm going to go relax and enjoy some calm sailing.

		<description><![CDATA[Merry Christmas! Wow, there's a lot to write about; where to begin...

Well, I suppose a good starting point is sailing superstitions. Specifically, as I found out from Ted early in our trip, it is notoriously bad luck to leave port on a Friday. Apparently this superstition was taken so seriously, at some points in history, that insurance companies would refuse coverage to vessels that violated it.

Unfortunately during the hectic stay in Pohnpei, and probably caused by our multiple delays of our departure date, we pulled out of the anchorage on Friday afternoon. A couple days later, when Ted realized this fact, he was quick to blame all of our early-voyage problems on it: the immigration fiasco, the entire day of steady rain, the slip down south in the counter-current and westerly winds.

As of Wednesday afternoon, despite my repeated sincere apologies to the sailing fates, it seemed that the curse was still in effect. We had recorded a 24-hour distance travelled of 49 nm, barely better than becalmed, and were still struggling to maintain 3 knots. We had even discussed pulling in to Chuuk for Christmas, despite having many reasons not to, just to reset our passage clock and leave on a less tarnished day of the week.

It was sometime late that afternoon that Japan came up. I don't remember exactly how or in what context, only that for some reason I had a whim to see how far away we were. After I checked, I casually remarked, "Hey, you know we're only 1800 miles from Japan? Maybe we should go there." Of course when I said it I was speaking in jest, but a moment later, Ted and I found ourselves asking, "Why shouldn't we go there?"

What followed was several hours of serious consideration. We looked at routes and timelines. We talked about various scenarios, job prospects, and visa issues. We enumerated pros (of which there were many) and cons (of which we could think of conspicuously few). By 7 pm, well after when Ted's usually asleep, we decided to table the discussion and sleep on it, not wanting to rush into such a dramatic alteration to our plans: if we could give it 3 hours, we could give it 18 hours.

The ideal scenario we'd mapped out went something as follows. We would alter course immediately for Guam, a mere 600 miles away, and a route with steady favorable wind and current. Then we would spend January and February island-hopping up the Mariana chain, a series of short 2-3 day passages. We would arrive in Japan in late February or early March (just in time for cherry blossom season). Because of weather patterns, once there we'd be pretty much committed to staying through the fall. This means we'd spend 8 months living there, hopefully finding jobs but with the fallback option of dipping into our savings to finance touring the country. Around November of 2010, we'd set sail again, passing through Hong Kong on our way to Singapore. From there we would pick back up our planned itinerary, only having gained 2-4 weeks, which would give us some breathing room to ensure crossing the Indian Ocean during the favorable NE monsoon.

The next morning we discussed some more, being a little more careful to soberly reflect on possible drawbacks or concerns. Ultimately we agreed we should probably go for it, but decided to hedge our bets a little. Due to the stronger trade winds above 9\xC2\xB0N, Guam can actually be used as a decent intermediate stop on the way to Palau, only losing a few days over the direct route. So we plan to go to Guam, and then look into as many details as we can that might change our minds (e.g. visa situation, job prospects, etc.). If we happen to find compelling reasons to reverse our choice, we'll have that out.

Personally, however, I'm pretty excited about the new plan, and doubt I'll change my vote. I can't speak for Ted, but here are some of my reasons for favoring the radical revision. First and perhaps foremost is a subconscious feeling that living in Japan for 8 months would be an awesome experience in and of itself, made all the more fun by the context of having arrived there by sailboat, and planning to leave the same way. I've always wanted to visit Japan, but never really felt like I had a worthwhile reason, nor a suitable opportunity.

A second reason is the favorable implications for the rest of the trip. Rather than spending the next three months racing to beat the monsoon, we'll get to enjoy a beautiful leisurely wandering up the Mariana Islands, with no time pressure at all. Then, when we eventually resume in the fall, the extra time will make the Indian Ocean crossing that much less stressful and more pleasant.

Third, stopping in a first world country and settling in for a while serves to break the sailing itself into more manageable chunks. During the stay in Japan, I can catch up on all the "real life" that's been piling up since we left Seattle. With luck I can work in a visit or two back to the States, and/or host some visitors in Japan. Not to mention the opportunity to put some work into the boat in the meantime; if one or both of us can sort out a decent short-term job, we might even be able to fund some capital improvements (an electric ice box sure would be nice, for example).

Of course there are some drawbacks too. There is a risk of not finding jobs, and thereby burning through a lot of savings, as cost of living there will not be cheap. There is also a risk of one or both of us deciding to give up on the rest of the trip, which I think is unlikely but certainly possible. None of these risks or a host of others feel bad enough to warrant not taking the chance, though. If we were willing to take on the risks of sailing around the world in the first place, the risk of having trouble getting a work visa seems pretty insignificant.

By far the biggest drawback for me is committing to another full year away from friends and family. The thought of it is a little daunting, to be sure. But, as mentioned, in a way this plan will let me stay in touch more, particularly in light of all our modern online communication options. It is effectively taking the same total amount of separation and spreading it thinner over a longer period. I hope my friends can forgive me for selfishly indulging in this manner; wanting them to understand my reasons is part of why I'm explaining them in such detail.

Of course the decision isn't final yet, and in Guam we could end up changing our minds. Truth be told, though, I suspect I will be mildly heartbroken if that happens. I've inexplicably fallen in love with the idea in a way I can't fully rationally justify. Still, if we don't go, we don't go. As Ted and I discussed, the decision is undoubtedly between awesome and amazing, so we can't really go wrong. And besides, the story of almost going to Japan would be nearly as good as actually having done it.

Enough about that for now though. There's one other anecdote I wanted to share. On Wednesday night after Ted went to sleep, I was on watch when a front blew through. In the span of an hour or so the wind picked up from 8-10 knots to 18-20, accompanied halfway through by a sudden burst of rain that subsided into a steady drizzle. And naturally, being at night, it was completely dark.

There was a time not too long ago when weather like this would have been intimidating, even scary. But it didn't faze me now, and I never once considered waking up Ted to help. I just calmly and easily handled the boat on my own, furling the jib, dropping the mizzen, reefing the main, and adjusting our course to the new wind. This is not, by the way, a boast of my ability over Ted's. On the contrary, he is unquestionably my superior in sailing skills, and a more natural seaman. But I did want to bring the experience up, as I think it's illustrative of both of us.

Despite the frequency with which we joke about our complete lack of skills and experience, the evidence seems to be mounting that we're respectable sailors. We're pretty close to having fully crossed the Pacific Ocean (which Ted eloquently described as "bigger than I thought"). It just goes to prove that with a little practice and determination, you can master anything you put your mind to. In our case, I guess it was a matter of sink, swim, or sail (sorry, couldn't resist).

Anyway, we're now comfortably on our way to Guam. We've already picked up the anticipated trades, and have been doing over 6 knots all afternoon. The forecast looks promising, and I think we'll make it there by the 29th (possibly even the 28th), with plenty of time to settle in before celebrating the New Year. I've already started thinking of resolutions - as you might imagine, there are lots of them.

		<description><![CDATA[We got a handful of questions before leaving Pohnpei. We split them up, so I answered half and Ted answered half. Here are the questions, with our responses.

Cheers,
Kevin

Q: What's the best part about sailing so far?
A [Ted]: Hello?

Q: What's the worst part about sailing?
A [Kevin]: The "limited social options," to put it euphemistically, is probably the worst aspect for me. Going weeks at a time only interacting with (the same) one other person gets pretty old (nothing against Ted). The flurry of extremely new and interesting social opportunities at each port makes up for it somewhat, but it's still the biggest drawback.

Q: Do you ever get tired of looking at water all day?
A [Ted]: I could ask you the same thing about land.

Q: Do you ever get bored?
A [Kevin]: There are lots of ways to keep occupied. I read (or listen to audiobooks). I write a lot - some in my journal, some on my reflections, some purely personal thoughts, and now answering questions like this. Preparing and eating meals takes up some time. Ted and I periodically spend hours arguing about politics, economics, religion, sociology, psychology, philosophy, physics, or just plain old arguing. Beyond that, pastimes get a little more dicey. Every hour or two I fire up the GPS and amuse myself by calculating our average speed over the last hour, the last 12 hours, the last day, and/or the trip thus far. Then I estimate, using one or all of those speeds, our expected arrival time at our destination, the next time zone, any landmasses, the longitudes of any notable places (e.g. when we first passed west of Fiji), and/or any other definable features I can think of. At night, if it's clear, I identify as many stars and constellations as I can; I'm up to around 10 and 20, respectively. Of course there are very occasional modifications to the sails to adjust for wind, and naturally a third of each day is spent sleeping. But other than all that, yes, the remaining 6-8 hours a day can be pretty boring :p

Q: What do you do to kill time?
A [Ted]: See above/below.

Q: Do you get homesick?
A [Kevin]: Yes and no. Homesick sort of implies a general longing to "be back home," with everything that entails, and I rarely feel that broad of a sentiment. On the other hand, there are many specific things from home (Seattle) that I periodically miss like crazy: my TV, my xbox, my friends (obviously), delivery Indian food, seeing Mt. Rainier every morning, and good Hefeweizen, just to name a few.

Q: What do you miss the most?
A [Ted]: Ice, ice-cold drinks, A/C, coldness.

Q: Do you ever see any other ships out in the ocean?
A [Kevin]: It's been pretty rare since Hawaii, but we've seen a few (if my count is right, I think it's 3). Before that it was a bit more common, perhaps one every 2-4 days, presumably because we were closer to shipping lanes. Just about all the other ships we've seen have looked commercial in nature, either fishing or shipping. There was one that wasn't obviously either, and might have been scientific research or something. Definitely no other sailboats or pleasure craft, though - not too many of us out here, and we're a lot smaller than the industrial guys.

Q: Is everything smaller in Micronesia?
A [Ted]: Not quite everything.

Q: Now that you've settled into the sailing life, what (if anything) has been an ongoing worry or concern? Or are you really such experts at this point that you're just hanging out on a boat thinking and relaxing?
A [Kevin]: Ted would probably say he has no concerns. For me, there are two things that linger in the back of my mind as vague worries: Running aground (or otherwise doing significant damage to the hull), and getting caught in a severe (> 50 knot) storm. The former is particularly a concern around here in the west Pacific, as there are many small low-lying atolls or reefs, and charts are not necessarily 100% reliable. The latter is a pretty small risk assuming we've done our route planning well, and can be mitigated by monitoring forecasts via SSB radio. Other than that though, it pretty much is just relaxing and enjoying life at sea.

Feel free to send more questions. Ted loves answering them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We've decided to head to Japan. Our tentative plan for getting there looks something like this:

-Leave Guam tomorrow-ish.
-Head for Saipan, possibly stopping at Rota on the way.
-After a brief stay in Saipan, plus resupplying and saying goodbye to the English-speaking world, depart for Chichi-jima, a small island in the Ogasawara chain, south of Tokyo.
-We've been told by the Japanese consulate that we can complete necessary immigration formalities in Chichi-jima. This may be complicated by the possibility of nobody there speaking English (the population of the island is about 2000). Hence, we'll be highly motivated in our Japanese studies between now and then.
-Once cleared through Chichi-jima, we have a clear route to Tokyo, where we expect to arrive sometime in early- to mid-February. Yes, it's going to be cold; at least Ted will stop complaining about the lack of refridgeration.

We'll keep up SPOT as usual, and SailMail as connectivity allows.

I'm looking forward to sending out my next on-shore updates from Japan :)

		<description><![CDATA[Follow-up: upon reflection, we decided February will be much more
pleasant in tropical islands than Tokyo, so I think we're going to
push back the trip north a bit. Same itinerary, but rather than a day
or two at the stops on the way, we'll spend a couple weeks. Probably
get to Tokyo in mid-March.

Rota (where we are now) is nice, albeit very quiet. They have a free
dock and free internet though, so on cost of living merits alone it's
a great spot. We'll be here for at least a week so feel free to get in
touch.

Time to go back to studying Japanese...

		<description><![CDATA[Wow I didn't realize it's been so long since I wrote anything. I guess ever since our plans for Japan came up, I've been pretty engrossed in thinking about/preparing for the new itinerary. Aside from looking into jobs, visas, and places to live, plus studying Japanese, I've spent a lot of time just contemplating the next year and getting childishly excited. Still, this is all part of the voyage, and I want to keep the record going so when I look back decades from now I can remember how wonderful it all was.

We got into Guam on the night of the 28th, and were helped onto a buoy by a very friendly Dutchman named (if I remember right) Hank. He was a good guy, sailing by himself in a gorgeous trimaran covered in sponsorship logos. While we were talking he casually dropped that he'd circumnavigated six times. He was headed for Okinawa, "because I've never been there before." I love meeting cruisers.

The mooring at Guam was actually pretty inconvenient. The buoy we were on was a solid 10 minute dinghy ride from shore at high tide. When the tide ebbed, a bunch of coral became exposed, and the route turned into a zig-zag maze that you pretty much had to row through (or risk smashing the propeller on coral). When you did get to the shore, there was no dock, so you got to drag the dinghy up 10 feet of dry beach so you could tie off to a tree.

On the plus side, once you'd gone through all this, you were standing at the lovely Mariana Yacht Club, a friendly place full of nice people who let us use the bathroom and showers and phone at no charge. Still, it's located about 20 minutes' drive from the main downtown area on Guam, which meant we just about had to rent a car the whole time we were there. Once we'd bitten that bullet, we gave in and got a cheap hotel room for a week too, and took turns on who got to sleep there vs. the boat. At least the hotel had free Wi-Fi, so we got to catch up on plenty of internet.

Guam's an interesting place. Ted accurately described it as being like Honolulu, except a little cheaper and way more Japanese tourists and "massage parlors." We had trouble finding any night spots we really liked, which is part of why we didn't stick around too long. Still, it had full first-world stores and restaurants and amenities, which was one welcome change from Pohnpei and Majuro. And I did have a good time on New Year's Eve, wandering down to the beach in Tamun (the central tourist/hotel district) and watching the fireworks.

While we were there, we took advantage of the fact that there was a Japanese Consulate just down the street from our hotel. We asked them about visas, and about how to go about clearing customs and immigration if and when we came through Chichi-jima (since it's a tiny island with no official port of entry). That promises to be a fun challenge - when we called the office the Consulate directed us to, they didn't speak any English (they didn't even understand my repeated attempts to ask "Does anyone there speak English?"); which experience added motivation to go to the University of Guam bookstore and pick up an introductory Japanese textbook (more on that later).

All that sorted out, we decided to move on from Guam pretty quickly, and actually managed to set sail the evening of the 5th. Working up to Rota was a bit of a chore, as the wind and current were both moderately against us, but it's only 50 miles and we were in no hurry. We pulled in to the harbor and dropped anchor Wednesday afternoon, and took the dinghy ashore to check the place out. On the way in, we realized there was a small but sturdy dock (hidden behind a breakwater) that was actually big and deep enough to fit Kallisti. Tying off to a dock is way better than anchoring, because (among other things) Ted and I can come and go separately: otherwise we have to coordinate shuttling back and forth in the dinghy. So the next day, we moved the boat in and tied off.

It was less than 10 minutes ashore before Ted and I were starting to like it here. The population of the island is about 3000, split mostly between two "towns": one up North where the airport is, and Songsong where we are.  Things are very quiet, but everyone is nice and friendly and literally dozens of locals have just come up to us at our boat to say hi and introduce themselves. They were also quick to offer advice - for example, we heard at least five different times that we might want to move our boat over to the harbor on the west side of the island, because it's more sheltered. We would later come to regret not taking that advice right away.

After just a couple days on the dock, a storm came in, bringing heavy winds (I'd guess the gusts were over 30) and a hard rain that lasted more than two days. The east harbor, where we'd docked Kallisti, was not a floating dock but just a big cement wall. For non-boaters, the reason this sucks is that when the tide rises and falls, the distance from your boat to the cleats on the dock gets longer or shorter, making your lines tighter or looser than you originally set them. This makes it tricky to get your boat secured snugly.

The east harbor also doesn't have much insulation from the incoming ocean swells, which results in a lot of rocking and being beaten against the dock. Long story short, after the first 24 hours of the storm, it was clear that we were not faring well. We'd had one of our deck cleats get ripped out, and a lot of the wood along the outside rail was chipped off from banging against the dock. Once the screws in the wood were exposed, most of our fenders got popped, so we had even less protection against the wall. We were increasingly worried that an especially strong gust or big wave could smack us hard enough to do some really serious damage. So yesterday morning we bit the bullet and decided to move over to the west harbor.

This wasn't as easy as those few simple words make it sound. The way we had docked, the waves were pushing us against the dock, and the wind was pushing us forward into the corner. In order to get out, we had to fight our way through a 90 degree left turn in very tight quarters, the weather meanwhile doing its best to make our lives difficult. We managed to do it, but there were a couple dicey moments when both the bow and stern were wedged against the dock walls, and our bow roller (the little spit at the front of the boat that the anchor chain runs over) got bent out of place pretty badly. Still, given the circumstances, we were lucky that was the only damage.

When we got settled in at the west harbor (fortunately a comparatively smooth process, though not without some exciting moments), we went through a bit of a post-mortem. It's been a while since we've really had to deal with this kind of adversity, and it's a crappy feeling when your boat gets beat up, but it's important to learn from the experience. Some of the lessons we took away: get bigger fenders; when possible, tie off in a way that keeps the boat off the dock; use stretchy lines, to prevent ripping cleats out; if you can, dock such that getting out will be easy (i.e. not where the wind/waves push you in); and above all, when a half dozen locals tell you to do something, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LISTEN.

Anyway, we're settled in at the new harbor now, and the weather has calmed a bit, so we can go back to enjoying the island. I've been spending a lot of time learning Japanese, and it's been a fun experience. I haven't studied a foreign language in almost ten years, and I've never done it when I had the time or motivation to really devote myself to it. It's very cool literally watching my brain program itself (look, I'm a computer scientist, what do you want from me). Right now I'm working on the writing systems (hiragana, katakana, and eventually kanji) and it's fascinating to see how I'm slowly learning to recognize all the different shapes and associate them with sounds and meanings. I can't wait until we're actually immersed amongst native speakers, and can really start learning more directly and quickly.

Aside from the Japanese, we've been having a great time hanging out with locals here. As with Pohnpei, we've found that the best part of the island is the people we've met and hung out with. I don't think I'll ever get tired of meeting a bunch of interesting folks in an unusual setting and sitting around sharing drinks and stories 'til 4 am. I miss a lot of things about the comfort and familiarity of the city-dweller lifestyle, but the wanderer's friends have a certain appeal that is hard to replace.

Since we decided Ted would fly to Honolulu from Saipan (instead of trying to rush to Tokyo), our pace has slowed down considerably. Our only deadline is being in Saipan by around February 8th, and it's a mere two days or so from here. So we can pretty much stay as long as we want, and have the option of leaving tomorrow or in three weeks. We'll play it by ear, but I'm guessing we won't be heading out anytime soon.

		<description><![CDATA[The last few weeks in Rota have been a wonderful time. Our new location in the west harbor coincidentally placed us next door to a couple of the early friends we made on the island, a pair of sisters from the mainland who've been living here for a couple years. Diana teaches 6th grade English at the local school and Julia is a bat biologist, studying an endangered species of fruit bat indigenous to the island. Since the harbor doesn't have anything by way of facilities, I pretty much adopted their house as my second home, and they've been very generous in not seeming to mind too much.

Through them, we've met a slew of other teachers, other biologists, and a handful of locals from assorted walks of life that wander by to say hi. There aren't a lot of entertainment options in a place this small, so sitting around talking becomes the main activity. I can imagine that after a few months/years you might yearn for a more active scene, but for me it's been a welcome and enriching change from the social isolation of the last four months. I feel like I've made some really good friends here and it's going to be tough to leave. Thank god for facebook and the other digital communication aids of the last decade, which allow me some cautious optimism about managing to keep in touch.

One of the thought-provoking elements of our stay here has been following Julia's work. The bat population on the island has apparently been devastated over the last decade or so, almost exclusively as a result of illegal poaching. It turns out that these fruit bats are a traditional delicacy, and despite the obvious decline in the population the poachers still frequently hit whole colonies. It seems one of their strategies is to just surround the colony and repeatedly blast it with shotguns, indiscriminately killing the adults and leaving dozens of orphan pups to starve or be eaten by crabs.

I like to think of myself as an environmentalist, in the sense of someone who cares about the environment and supports policies of respectful cohabitation with the natural world. But this is the first time I've really had direct personal exposure to such a flagrant disregard for maintaining a balanced relationship with our environment. Even if you support hunting, and even if you view the eating of these bats as an important cultural tradition, there can be little justification for a practice which is so blatantly unsustainable. If it continues at the rate it's going, the bats may be eradicated entirely within decades, maybe less. It should be obvious that nobody benefits from such an outcome.

To me, the predicament of the bats on Rota is a microcosm of a broader issue facing humanity today. Our modern (Western) culture has consistently proven itself to be extremely short-sighted. The idea that we need to understand the long-term consequences of our actions, and build the mechanics of our society upon a strict foundation of sustainability, seems to have utterly failed to take root amongst our leaders and decision-makers. Why we are not more alarmed at this situation, nor more aggressively taking action to remedy it, continues to mystify me. Seeing a direct negative effect of our negligent attitude has increased my motivation to seek out a more active way to advance this cause.

One of the problems that Julia has had in trying to fight the poaching is a lack of enforcement of the legal protections afforded to the endangered species. It seems like the local political structures are quick to turn a blind eye to the problems, and often those responsible for enforcing the rules are amongst those violating them. Help against such corruption should be available from the federal level, but for various reasons (presumably tied to funding and prioritization) no concrete action has been taken. And so with no one punishing those who break the rules, the poaching continues undeterred, and the bats are rapidly paying the price.

I don't want to be one of those people who sympathizes with a problem but does nothing about it. I may not be able to catch and arrest a poacher, but that doesn't mean I'm powerless. I think one of the most important things we can all do to stop this kind of thing is to talk about it more, and to build a societal awareness that sustainability is a top priority. It is also of course the case that money talks, and Julia could always use additional funding for things like surveillance and education programs. I'm lucky enough to have a moderate audience reading this journal, so I figured I'd solicit help here for anyone who'd care to lend a hand. If you'd like to give money, ideas, or even just moral support, e-mail me and I will happily get you in touch.

Besides hearing about bats and meeting the locals (and of course studying Japanese), we've managed to get out and see the island a bit as well. And there are some quite beautiful places. Last week Julia invited me and Ted to go on a hike with her up to a cliff near the top of the island, where she was doing a survey of a non-colonial bat site. After a drive up a long dirt/grass "road" barely wide enough to fit the truck, we got out and hiked about an hour through jungle thick enough to warrant a machete. We suddenly emerged atop a rock overlooking the entire town and southwest spit of land, over a thousand feet below. The scene was nothing short of spectacular.

Then this past weekend, we took a hike to a spot known locally as "the grotto." Another hour through thick jungle led us to a hole right along the cliffs at the tip of the island. Sitting at the bottom of the 50-foot-deep gap in the rock was a deep pool, and after climbing down a ways, we braved a 10 foot jump down into the water. The pool had no direct view of the open ocean, but if you dove down with a mask on you could see the seawater flowing in through an underwater cave entrance, the sunlight pouring through the far side. Swimming towards this, we veered off to the left to emerge into an almost entirely isolated chamber about 20 feet in diameter and with 5-10 feet of clearance between the water and the ceiling. We stayed in there for over an hour, taking lots of pictures/video and enjoying the unique atmosphere. I finally got some good use out of my waterproof camera.

As wonderful as all that has been, the time has come for us to move on. We're planning to set sail tonight for Tinian/Saipan, a quick 75 mile passage that we should do in a couple days (even despite the wind and current being against us). Then we'll have a couple weeks to spend there before Ted goes to Honolulu and I go to Tokyo, February 10th-20th. I can't help but wonder whether it's possible we can keep having such fantastic experiences everywhere we go; are there really this many cool people and places in the world? I've always hoped the answer was yes, but now I'm starting to believe it might actually be true.

To everyone that we met in Rota: thanks for all the great times and happy memories. You've been wonderful hosts and true friends, and I sincerely hope we manage to keep in touch and meet up again somewhere down the road. Until then, best wishes and keep being you.

		<description><![CDATA[I just got back yesterday from my 10-day scouting trip to Tokyo. The last month seems to have gone by in a blink, and I can hardly believe that in a few short days we'll finally be setting sail for Chichijima. It feels like forever since our last real ocean passage (the day-hops up to Rota and Saipan hardly count), and I'm for the most part I'm excited to be back at sea. Of course, there are a few aspects of the passage-making process that I'm not looking forward to, but if it was all easy and fun it would hardly be an adventure.

I'd like to write about a few of the things that have been keeping me busy over the last four weeks. I guess I should mention that, if you're curious what Ted's been up to, this entry's not for you - I've barely seen him since we got to Saipan. I think we've both been taking advantage of the much-needed opportunity to do our own thing for a while. If you'd been crammed in a tiny space with the same person, all day every day for five months, you'd feel the same way.

Anyway, the first new hobby I've discovered is a form of "bird watching," except the "birds" in this case are satellites. A former co-worker of mine, prompted by my confessions of my new love for astronomy in this journal, pointed me at a website for predicting exactly when and where satellites will be visible in the night sky. You provide your exact latitude, longitude, and altitude (pretty much always 0 for us), and it can literally give you the exact time and position that each pass will occur, as well as how bright it will be.

Armed with this awesome tool, I've taken advantage of some of the clearer Saipan nights to sit out and watch for satellites. So far, I've successfully spotted just about every satellite I was looking for, and it's been amazing how accurate and precise the website's predictions have been. I think part of what makes this such a fun pastime for me is that it really drives home just how sophisticated our understanding of the world is. To be able to point at a spot in the sky and say, "In exactly 10 seconds, there will be a bright flash there, moving down and to the West," and then watch it happen, feels quite a lot like magic.

The other, completely unrelated activity I've discovered is something I was introduced to by a friend on Rota. It's called hashing, and the basic idea is that a group of people get together, run through the jungle for an hour or two, and then gather round a fire and drink lots of beer together. On Saipan there's a hash every Saturday, and I managed to go to both the ones I was on island for. It's no surprise based on my past interests, but I immediately loved it. The exercise is great, you see some really unusual and "off the beaten path" places, and on top of that it's a really fun social circle and a way to meet new friends.

But what really got me hooked was when I did some more research about hashing. It turns out, this isn't just an isolated thing in Saipan, or even in the Pacific islands. Hashing is a fully international phenomenon with over 2000 different groups worldwide, supposedly present in just about every major city. (If you want to know more, check Google/Wikipedia for "Hash House Harriers.") So not only is it a great activity in and of itself, but if you happen to be traveling around the world, it's a fantastic way to have an instant social group almost anywhere you go.

To test this out, I decided to look into hashing during my visit to Tokyo. Despite it being freezing cold, there were hashes almost every day that I was there, and I managed to make it out to two of them. Both were a ton of fun, and I'm looking forward to getting back to Tokyo in a few months so I can run with them again. I even made some friends there who became my social hosts for the next few nights, giving me the insider's tour of some Tokyo nightlife. I'm so impressed with the hashing culture that I'm really kicking myself for not knowing about it sooner, since there are (unsurprisingly) at least 3 or 4 different hash groups in Seattle that I could have been running with all this time.

Apart from these new hobbies, I've found that I've really settled into the traveling lifestyle. It seems like I've been "on the road" long enough now, with no end in sight, that I've stopped feeling like a visitor everywhere I go. Instead I just always feel at home. It's like somewhere along the line a switch in my psyche flipped, and I reverted to the nomadic hunter-gatherer instincts which our species lived by for so long. What's more, I absolutely love it. Sure, it can be a little disorienting sometimes, but the chance to always be experiencing something new and different is like candy for my mind.

One of the side effects of this attitude-shift is that the travel has ceased to be the defining part of my day-to-day life. Instead it forms the background for whatever else I feel like doing, and while some days that's exploring the new things and places around me, I'm also finding time to do more long-term activities. For example, one of the reasons for my sparse journal entries is that I've been putting a lot of effort into another writing project. It may or may not go anywhere, but I really like being able to work on something like this on top of the ever-changing context of novel and interesting people and places. In terms of helping to stimulate new thoughts and new ideas, it can't be beat.

And the next scenery change is certainly going to be a big one. As I mentioned, our plan is to leave Saipan early this week and head up to Chichijima. It will be the first stop on our trip where English is not the primary language, and with a total population of 2000 people, it may be hard to even find anyone who speaks it. I got a little taste of this in my 10 days in Tokyo, and found that the little Japanese I've managed to pick up is a far cry from what's needed to hold even a basic conversation. Trying to clear through customs and immigration should be festive.

Another important piece of information gleaned from my Tokyo visit is that it is, indeed, very cold there right now. Based partially upon this shocking revelation, we may end up hanging out in Chichijima for a while and wait until the forecast shows some warmer temperatures and favorable winds. Being able to cherry-pick your departure windows is definitely one of the many advantages to a more flexible schedule.

Plans for after we leave Chichijima are still completely up in the air. Our original thought was to go straight for Tokyo, but so far the search for a cheap (or even moderately-priced) marina in that area hasn't gone well. So we may end up just going there for a few weeks or a month, or going someplace else first, or skipping Tokyo entirely. There's also the question of whether, and where, either or both of us might find jobs. And still the possibility remains of selling the boat, if we happen to find someone who wants it badly enough. Basically, there are so many unknowns that trying to predict where we'll be or what we'll be doing three months from now is all but impossible. And to be honest, that's just the way I like it.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, remember me? Guess it's been a while since I posted anything. Well, our lazy stay in the CNMI is finally over. We've got all our supplies ready and have our paperwork taken care of to clear out of Saipan tomorrow morning. We'll be heading up to Chichijima, following our way along the northern stretch of the Marianas chain (winds permitting).

We're considering stopping off at Pagan Island (and/or one or two other islands along the way). Reports of the current population on Pagan are mixed, ranging from 0 to a few dozen people, so we really have no idea what to expect. Anyway, if we seem to be going slower than usual, it's probably because we ended up having an island to ourselves and don't want to leave. The SPOT coverage map claims that we should be in range by then, and we'll certainly try sending updates; we'll see what gets through.

Cheers,
Kevin

P.S. If you're bored, fire up Google maps and try to find the 3 or 4 buildings on Pagan, which or may or may not be abandoned now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, passagemaking, I had almost forgotten what it's like. It's such a surreal experience as compared to life on land that sometimes I find it hard to see the two as part of the same lifetime. When I'm at sea it's as if my days ashore were just a dream, and in reality I've been on this boat all along. And yet I know that when we reach our next port, it will only take a few hours for the passage itself to fade into a dream.

The weather so far this trip has been all over the map. We've seen a light southerly (very unusual here), to almost becalmed, to beating into a fresh north wind, and just about everything in between. We've been engaged in the last of these for the past 12 hours or so, and with mounting seas it's been a lovely time (that's sarcasm, for those who couldn't tell). I can definitely reaffirm my opinion of upwind sailing: it sucks.

We had a fun little adventure yesterday going ashore on Anatahan. It's a small, uninhabited island about 60 miles north of Saipan. It's also an active volcano which most recently erupted in 2008. The first challenge was finding a place where we could actually get ashore, as most of the coast consists of rocky cliffs. We managed to find a small, somewhat insulated cove on the west side, which had a thin stretch of black beach. I won't say "black sand" because it wasn't really sand, but a rather unpleasant gritty consistency of small rock.

The beach wasn't the only unpleasant thing, either. Before we'd finished anchoring our boat was swarming with flies, whose ability to so rapidly find us 200 yards offshore was quite impressive. After we took the dinghy in to the beach the flies only got worse. We set out to find a path to hike inland a bit, hoping to make it to a ridgeline for some good views. Our first few attempts met with abject failure: the combination of steep inclines and loose ash made the terrain impassable. Between the flies and the midday heat (there was no shade anywhere) we weren't feeling terribly optimistic.

On one last try at finding a way up, we stumbled into what looked like a rainwater runoff trough. While not easy going, we were able to scramble up this for 10 or 15 minutes, but eventually hit another wall. By this point the flies were a dense cloud, so we turned back and headed for the beach. Seeing the boat still anchored where we left it was a relief; remember, this was only our second time anchoring, ever.

Getting off the beach with our dinghy provided one last challenge for the morning. The beach was sheltered and the winds had been fairly calm, so the waves coming in were only a couple feet. But with both of us on board, that was still enough to flip or spin us. We eventually solved the problem by having me just swim along behind after helping push the dinghy out, leaving my bag and shirt on board. Fortunately I'd anticipated something like that might happen, and worn my bathing suit.

All in all, we both agreed that Anatahan is by far the worst place we've stopped so far. I guess it makes sense that it's uninhabited. So now we're about 40 miles from Pagan, and will have to decide whether we want to check out going ashore there. I guess we'll just head that way and see how we feel.

		<description><![CDATA[The weather's been pretty rough these past few days. We ended up skipping Pagan because the winds were just being too uncooperative. First, as we approached it from the south, a strong north/northeast wind picked up. So we spent Thursday night beating on the starboard tack, planning to cut east-southeast Friday morning. But when morning came the wind had shifted to the east, and we found ourselves scarcely any closer than 24 hours earlier.

After fighting into the wind again all day Friday, by the late afternoon it was clear we wouldn't get there by sunset. We had two choices: spend the night basically "killing time," sailing north and then back south to get in at sunrise, or give up on Pagan altogether. We talked about it for a bit. It would have been really cool to go there and see the abandoned houses, or even cooler to meet the handful of inhabitants, if there were any. On the other hand, the heavy winds were building up some significant seas, and we couldn't be sure we'd even be able to anchor and get ashore safely. So we did what we usually do when we can't decide: heads, we go to Pagan, tails, we skip it.

Well, the flip came up heads. We both looked at each other and said, "Damn, I was really hoping for tails." I think beating into the wind for two full days had taken its toll on us, and we were anxious to start actually making headway towards Chichijima. So, we decided to overrule the coin. In our defense, part of the point of deciding with coin flips is to help surface your sub/semi-conscious leanings, and in this case it worked.

Since heading north from Pagan we've still been in pretty rough seas though. The wind has been consistently in the mid-twenty-knot range, and the waves have steadily grown, with some of them now well into the teens. Fortunately the wind has stayed mostly northeasterly, so we've been able to stay on our desired heading up the Marianas chain without tacking, but we've been close-hauled (tight into the wind) or near it just about constantly.

The annoyances of sailing upwind in heavy seas are many. Aside from the obvious pitching and rolling caused by the waves tossing you around, there's the constant 20+ degree heel, which makes every little activity ten times harder. Then there's the noise, as whenever you hit a big swell the wrong way the boat's hull smashes loudly against it. This makes getting a decent night's sleep almost impossible, and is disquieting even when you're awake.

Possibly the worst part, though, is the splashing. The rougher seas make getting splashed in the cockpit much more common, and going upwind magnifies this as the waves are coming at you. It can get to the point, as it's been these past two days, where if you spend more than a minute or two on deck you can expect to get drenched. This in turn means you can't really read, write, eat, or nap in the cockpit, so you have to spend your watch below and pop up every 15 minutes to check things out. And still, inevitably, you get drenched at least four or five times a day.

Complaining aside, it's actually been pretty awesome seeing all the Mariana islands as we pass by, even if we're not going ashore. Each seems to have its own unique features and character, and I've found all of them to be quite beautiful in their own ways. As I'm writing we're approaching Maug, the second-to-last stop in the chain. By tomorrow morning we'll have cleared them all and have a straight shot to Chichijima. After all this rough weather I really can't wait to get there, and start yet another chapter in this adventure.

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, let me just say this: Maug was incredible. It's a little ring of three islands which form the protruding portions of a volcano's crater rim. The whole of the crater floor is under water, and between each island there are channels through which a boat may pass. Yesterday around 5 pm, as the sun was getting low and a picturesque moon was rising, we sailed into the crater. As we got north of the channel and into the east island's lee the winds (still blowing hard outside) quieted to a gentle breeze.

We made our way to the middle of the crater, unable to resist the temptation of sending a SPOT update from there (I hope it went through). Our depth sounder confirmed a fascinating feature claimed by our charts: while most of the crater floor is 500 feet or deeper, in the middle the volcano's cone rises to only 70 feet below sea level. From this spot we surveyed the scene, and it was truly quite majestic. I've been lucky enough to see some spectacular natural wonders in my life, but this easily ranked among the best of them. Its remoteness, and the knowledge that only a handful of people in the world have seen (and probably will ever see) it, certainly helped make it memorable for me.

Meanwhile, what a difference a day makes. Last night the fierce wind gradually subsided to a modest but steady breeze, veering to the southeast and allowing us to run downwind with jib-and-jigger. When I awoke this morning it was to bright sun and not a cloud in sight. The waves have quieted enough that, on our downwind tack, we're not getting splashed anymore. And much to Ted's delight our increasing latitude (nearly out of the tropics!) has finally yielded a more pleasant daytime temperature. The wind has stayed just strong enough to push us along at a healthy 5.5-6 knots, and all in all it's pretty much ideal sailing weather. There really is a metaphor for life here: what a difference a day makes.

Being back at sea has rekindled my reading and writing projects that had been shoved to the back burner during our various shore leave. Obviously my pace of writing in this journal has picked back up, but I've also gone through two books in the past four days. One of them was Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, which has both shamed me for not reading more of his work sooner and inspired me to remedy this as soon as possible. I think that it may make my top ten favorites of all time, and maybe even introduced me to my next religion. Busy, busy, busy.

As the miles tick by, it gets harder and harder to think of anything but Chichijima. If this good wind holds out (knock on wood) we could conceivably get there on Wednesday. We spent a few minutes this afternoon trying to figure out how to say some key phrases in Japanese, like "We are a 36-foot American sailboat" or "Where should we dock?" My guess is that unless somebody there speaks English, we won't be able to understand anything anyway. Communicating via radio is hard enough even without the language barrier. If we can't manage radio comms, we'll have to just go ashore and see what happens. In three more days...

		<description><![CDATA[Well, obviously hoping to arrive by today was being overly optimistic. I had barely finished writing Sunday's entry when the winds started dwindling away, and by Monday morning we were pretty much becalmed. I think when we're making good time I have a tendency to assume that those favorable conditions will last indefinitely. No worries though, a little self-delusion never hurt anybody, and it helps to pass the time.

Monday's calm provided an opportunity to give swimming in the open ocean another try. Ted sat this one out, but since I hadn't showered or bathed in a week I couldn't resist. This time, I amused myself by jumping in with my camera (the waterproof option was definitely a good call) and getting some pictures and video from that unique perspective. As with the last such swim the water was lovely, and rinsing off all the accumulated sweat, sunscreen, and salt felt great (even though the salt was, naturally, replenished).

Just when we were starting to think about motoring for a while a promising little breeze crept up Monday afternoon. We put up some sail and though it was slow going at first we've steadily built up some speed. During the day yesterday it was looking like we'd be struggling to make Chichijima by Saturday. We're really hoping to get there by Friday afternoon, as we can't be sure the various customs/immigration officials will even be working over the weekend. Fortunately, we've had a pretty decent wind all day today and a Friday arrival seems more and more plausible. Of course the winds can always change yet again, but the closer we get the smaller the window of uncertainty becomes.

In other news, we're unquestionably starting to feel the effects of sailing towards Polaris for a week (in the winter). For pretty much all of our passages since Hawaii I've never felt it necessary to wear more than shorts and a t-shirt, even on a windy night watch. But over the past few days I've been gradually adding layers after sunset. Last night I had a sweatshirt plus a windproof jacket, and when I wasn't moving around it was still a little chilly. Don't get me wrong: it's nowhere near the bone-chilling cold we endured going down the coast to San Francisco, but the change in climate is tangible. (All that said, I'm in the cockpit with shorts and no shirt as I'm writing this, just to keep things in perspective.)

With our arrival in Japan getting inexorably nearer, I've been stepping up my Japanese studying, or trying to anyway. I'm making a lot of progress but still have quite a ways to go before I'll be comfortable trying to hold a conversation. At least learning is still a lot of fun; if anything, the more I study the more I like it. I feel like there's a "critical mass," a point in the learning curve over which things will get a lot easier, and I'm slowly approaching it. Once my vocabulary, grammar, and reading skills have reached a certain minimum level, then I'll be able to pick up new material way faster. That ought to be a blast.

It's hard to believe that it's March already. We're only two weeks from the six-month mark for this voyage, and three from my 27th birthday. How time flies when you're having fun. I can't say the last half year has gone how I thought it would, but if anything it's been far better than my expectations. If anyone reading this is considering following our example (whether in the exact sense or just in doing something crazy and different), my advice is: go for it.

		<description><![CDATA[Another day, another perfect island life. We made it into Chichijima on Friday as we'd hoped, and after just a few days I've already settled into a pretty comfortable daily routine. As expected things here are pretty quiet, and it's reflected in my activities. I wake up and wander into town, find a bench in a park by the beach, and read or study Japanese for a few hours. Then I get lunch, which has usually been ramen, but the ramen here is nothing like what you find in the states. I could happily eat it every day. Then in the afternoon I do some more studying/reading, and starting yesterday I've added jogging to the schedule. After another trip back into town for dinner, I wander to one of the few small bars and hang out for a while, having a few drinks and trying to talk with the locals. Between my limited but improving Japanese and their combined English (which is sparse but enough to get by) we manage to communicate, and it's great practice for me.

I don't mention any computer time in there because the only internet access is town is a 30 minute walk from our boat, up a steep hill, and costs 200 yen/hour. As a result I've only bothered going there once so far, the first night we arrived. I guess I'll head back this afternoon to send out these latest journal entries, and maybe try to upload some pictures. The connection's not the fastest, so we'll see how it goes. Normally I'd be dying from being so cut off from the 'net, but I've found that without the constant distraction I can focus much more on studying (reading, running, etc.).

The wind did end up dying off after all, for the last couple days of the trip, so in order to make it here Friday we had to use the engine for 10 or 15 hours. Since our electronic autopilot is still broken, we have to hand-steer the whole time we're motoring, which makes it a pretty unpleasant experience. I guess not so much unpleasant per se as just really, really boring. Imagine driving on the highway for 4 or 5 straight hours, only the scenery doesn't change at all. Incidentally, as a point of reference, a full round of "99 bottles of beer on the wall" only lasts about 15 minutes. I think you can imagine how I know that.

Our experience coming ashore proved to be just as interesting as I thought it would be, though not in the way I expected. We came into the harbor and after looking around a bit, found one long pier that looked like it had plenty of empty space on it. We figured we'd pull up there and try to find someone to ask where we should go or who we needed to talk to. Before we'd even secured ourselves to the dock, three or four guys were there to help us, and it turned out they were from the various agencies we needed to see: customs, port control, etc. Once we were all tied up they started right into filling out paperwork and getting us cleared in. Their English was far from fluent, but enough to tell us what we needed to do. All in all it was a very impressive first impression, and this was easily the best organized and most professional experience we've had clearing into a port.

The flipside is, it was also one of the most bureaucratic experiences. Each agency had at least two or three forms for us to fill out, and some of the questions they asked seemed pretty asinine, at least for a 2-person sailboat. For example, we had to provide a history of every stop we've made so far this trip (i.e. since Seattle), including arrival and departure date and time for each. They also informed us about some rules and regulations that, to us, seemed unnecessarily restrictive. Apparently Chichijima is a "closed port," which we're told means that we're not allowed to take the boat out for any day trips while we're here, but have to stay docked the entire time. Additionally, if we want to have any Japanese guests on board, even just to show them around, they have to fill out a form and get permission from customs.

Taken as a whole, the experience certainly didn't contradict any of the stereotypes I've heard about Japanese culture. They are very nice and very efficient, but it is also highly controlled and regulated. The necessity of rules and the habit of following them without question seem deeply ingrained in the society's mindset. But I guess part of the point of travelling is to see such cultural differences, and hopefully as a result to better understand and appreciate your own home. Anyway, they're letting us stay at the dock for a month for free, so overall I'm pretty happy with the arrangement.

I doubt this will come as news to anyone, but one of my favorite hobbies is coming up with little aphorisms to summarize what I like to think of as my "wisdom." At any rate, they summarize whatever thoughts I happen to be mulling over at the time. I guess it's something like simplifying an algebraic expression. Anyway, during my run yesterday I came up with this one, which I present here for your consideration: "The greatest trap in life is to suppose that your success determines your happiness, rather than vice versa."

		<description><![CDATA[Life in Chichijima continues to be pretty quiet, so I don't have all that much to write about, but I thought I'd jot down a few things. I'm still feeling a little guilty about not writing anything the entire month we were in Saipan. Besides, with so little else to do, it's another way to pass the time.

The weather has been somewhat of a mixed bag. The first weekend here was gorgeous, but during the week a cold front came through, and for two or three days it was actually pretty chilly. The wind was howling pretty fiercely as well (somehow it's always windy when we're on a non-floating dock), and the combination forced us to break out clothing that we hadn't touched since San Francisco. It's warmed back up somewhat recently, but the nights still necessitate long pants and a sweatshirt, minimum. I really hope spring arrives in the next couple weeks, or else the trip to Tokyo will be freezing.

My daily routine hasn't changed much from what I described in the last entry. Last week I logged just about three hours' jogging (over four separate runs), and it feels great to be getting my legs some sustained exercise again. The island is quite hilly, which makes running less pleasant but also better training. Meanwhile, my Japanese studies are coming along nicely as well. I'm still not able to hold a full conversation with native speakers (they talk so fast!) but my progress even from a week ago is really noticeable.

There are absolutely gorgeous spots all over the place here; all you have to do is pick a road and walk until you see a trail cutting off (usually just a few minutes), and it will go either up a hill to a spectacular lookout or else down to a secluded sunny beach. We're told that the whole island is part of a national park, and it's easy to understand why.

On an unrelated note, here's an amusing little anecdote: yesterday afternoon, Ted and I happened to run into an American guy who's living here and teaching English. He invited us to barbeque on one of afore-mentioned beautiful beaches, and we ending up hanging out and talking for a few hours (each of us glad to find another native English speaker). Three hours later, we stumbled upon that fact that he went to high school with a girl I knew quite well in college! Here we are, just about literally on the other side of the world, on a tiny Japanese island, and we have a close mutual acquaintance. If "small world" doesn't capture that, I'm not sure what does.

This weekend another cruising boat arrived, a German couple aboard Freydis. Like most of the cruisers we've met, they've been doing it for many years and have been all over the world. Apparently they sailed all the way around Antarctica (many times, I gather) and visited all the little islands around its coast. While I'm sure that was an amazing experience, it also sounds really cold. I stand by my "stay in the tropics" stance.

Their plan, like ours, is to head from here up towards Tokyo, so hopefully we'll get together and compare notes on route and weather. Despite the fact that we managed to sail across the Pacific, we still mostly feel like we have no clue what we're doing, so it's always good to double-check with the veterans.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I'm 27 years old now. As birthdays go, this one seems pretty insignificant. Three years from now I may feel differently, but for now I'm too busy enjoying life to worry too much about that number's distinctly upward trend. Nevertheless, it's as good a reason as any for a celebration, and I'm looking forward to a party with many of the cool Chichijima residents we've met over the past three weeks.

As with every other place we've stopped, my favorite part has undoubtedly been the people. It took a little longer here to get settled in (because of the language barrier), but all the same I've made some good friends. I have my very own little bar that I've been going to almost nightly, and by now I'm pretty much a regular, on a first name basis with the owner/bartender and most of the clients. Our ability to communicate is pretty limited, and sometimes we spend 20 minutes trying to get across one simple idea, but we have a hell of a good time trying.

Last Sunday I got invited to a barbeque out on a beautiful beach a little ways south of the main town. I went there with Alan, the English teacher I mentioned in the last entry, plus another American named Masa who was here filming for a documentary. Masa happens to be bilingual, which made him a really handy friend to have, because he was nice enough to tirelessly translate for us. We spend the whole afternoon and evening eating round after round of delicious grilled food and drinking beer and whiskey, and then rounded everyone up and went to a bar afterwards. It was a fantastic time and one of the best days I can remember on the whole trip.

Another fun treat came Tuesday. Monday night I had been out at my regular bar, when I happened to be introduced to the captain of the Ogasawara Maru, who was stopping in for a drink. (The Ogasawara Maru is an ocean liner with a 1000-person capacity, which makes weekly trips between Chichijima and Tokyo.) Anyway, he invited me and Ted (through a mix of broken English and simple Japanese) to join him and his crew for a friendly softball game. So Tuesday we found ourselves enjoying a sunny afternoon out on the sports field, sharing in our countries' mutual pastime. Aside from the fact that I always love to play baseball/softball, this was also the sort of random but awesome experience that continues to make our travels so fun. I just never know what to expect next.

And still, as always, the saddest part is having to leave. We only have permission to stay docked here through April 4th, which means we'll have to depart sometime next week. As excited as I am to go to Tokyo, this is going to be a tough place to leave, and these will be tough people to say goodbye to. It's a good thing we have Facebook and e-mail, so at least we can hope to try and stay in touch; I can't imagine these farewells without that option to soften the blow. Of course I'll have to e-mail most of them in Japanese, but that's just all the more incentive to keep studying! And on that note, I'm going to go read a few more pages of my textbook before tonight's party.

		<description><![CDATA[After a very pleasant 29-day stay on Chichijima, we said our final goodbyes and cast off yesterday afternoon. It definitely ranked among Rota and Pohnpei as one of my favorite stopes of the trip. The various parks, beaches, and hiking trails are gorgeous and well-maintained, and the people I met were all friendly and fun. I hope I get a chance to come back and visit someday.

Now we're back at sea again, gradually chipping away at the last 500 miles to Tokyo. The grand plans we laid back in January have all gone surprisingly smoothly so far, and with the goal so close it's hard not to be excited. The weather seems to be cooperating, more or less, and despite it being a little chilly we're making decent time. Bearing in mind my tendency to be overly optimistic with these estimates, I think we can make Tokyo by Friday.

We've made arrangements to take the boat in to a visitor berth at Yumenoshim Marina. While still outrageously expensive compared to anywhere else we've stayed, this was the cheapest option I could find in the Tokyo Bay area. The location is actually fairly convenient for accessing the city's sights and nightlife, given the constraint of having to be on the waterfront. Hopefully it will prove to be a decent accommodation for the next month or two.

My flight to go back to the states leaves Tokyo on Thursday the 15th. If we get in on Friday (or even Saturday or Sunday) that should still give me enough time to explore the city a bit more. My Japanese is immensely better now than it was during my February visit, so I'm really looking forward to trying to talk more with locals. Hopefully I can also hook back up with one or two of the Tokyo hashes, and thereby satisfy some running-and-drinking needs.

The trip home has me pretty excited as well. I will have been gone for seven months, but it feels like a lifetime. There have been a lot of ups, and a few downs, but every bit has been a great opportunity for me to learn and grow. In some ways I feel like a whole new person now. Going back and seeing friends and family will be a chance to reconcile all these new experiences with my past life, and in so doing hopefully drive home the lessons I've learned. Plus, I have a wicked craving for some American pizza (which, at the end of the day, may be the most important lesson).

There is one bit of unfortunate news to report regarding the current passage. The windvane, which Ted and I have repeatedly rated as our most valuable and beloved piece of equipment, doesn't seem to be working. Apparently a month of sitting idle wasn't good for it, and something got rusted/jammed/otherwise fubar. Consequently we're stuck either hand-steering or faking something halfass with bungee cords (the latter being currently employed). This isn't a very fun situation, but fortunately it's a shot trip. Knowing the reward is sailing into Tokyo Bay, I'm willing to tough it out.

		<description><![CDATA[The proverb "when it rains, it pours" has been in abundant evidence so far this passage. On the more literal front, we had a storm blow through yesterday, and with it came a steady rain pretty much all day long. With the windvane still broken, we were stuck doing alternating 12 hour shifts at the wheel, out in the cold and rain (and, for half the time, dark). Suffice to say it was not the most enjoyable day of my life.

On top of that discomfort, we've had a series of additional equipment problems. The list doesn't quite match the pile of disasters from the Seattle-to-San-Francisco leg, but it's easily in second, and we still have 250 miles to go. After the windvane, the next thing to go was the traveler for the main boom. During my shift Sunday night, I needed to leave the wheel for a moment to turn on the masthead light. Unfortunately I left the wheel a bit too far downwind, and we gybed. When I went back to reverse the gybe before we got all the way around, the boom swung too hard and cracked the wooden rail that the traveler was mounted on. So now we can't use the mainsail at all, or we risk causing further damage. (Note, by the way, that this was more or less directly caused by the windvance being inoperable - another case of problems begetting more problems.)

The following morning around 4 am, Ted heard an unusual sound coming from the propeller. I woke up and took a look, and discovered that the bilge had filled with water (the sound was the propeller shaft splashing the water). Apparently, the automatic activation mechanism on the bilge pump broke somehow. Luckily the pump itself still works if turned on manually, but now we have to remember to do this every 2-3 hours or risk a very messy and unpleasant bilge overflow. This particular malfunction is especially annoying so close to a planned extended stay at a docked, where automatic bilge pumping is pretty much the only thing that needs to work.

Lastly, we've noticed that our masthead tricolor light seems to periodically lose its white and/or green components. It's probably just loose wiring somewhere. If this were the only problem we had it wouldn't be a big deal, but on top of the others it adds to the annoyance. I guess I shouldn't be surprised anymore: if there's one thing I've learned about sailing, it's that something is always breaking.

On the bright side the rain let up late last night, and so far today has been warm and sunny. The wind has been a very uncooperative northwesterly, resulting in very slow progress, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will turn soon. A Friday arrival still isn't out of the question, but we'll need a little luck to make it. Meanwhile 12 hours a day of hand-steering has worn me out, so I'm going to sneak in a nap before my 3-12 shift.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, it hasn't exactly been the most fun week of the trip, but we're finally almost to Tokyo. Unfortunately we're just a little too late to make it all the way through the Bay before it gets dark today, so we'll probably wait out the night offshore and head in at first light tomorrow. All told it looks like we'll finish the passage in a week, which is about what I expected, but it's felt a lot longer.

The rest of the day Tuesday (after my last entry) and most of Wednesday were very light winds, often totally becalmed. When the wind finally picked up Wednesday night it took the form of a sudden and violent squall, which subsided into yet another north wind. It wasn't til early Thursday morning, as the wind gradually shifted to the east, that we started making decent progress towards Tokyo. Even then it was beating into a heavy wind and rough seas, making for an uncomfortable (and increasingly cold) passage.

The ongoing lack of a functional windvane has continued to make life unpleasant. As with anything, we've gradually adapted to it, and now that we're almost to Tokyo the next few shifts will be much easier. Knowing you're on the home stretch makes virtually any inconvenience seem bearable. Still I will look back on this trip as a reminder of just how important the windvane is.

It's not uncommon among offshore cruisers to name their windvane units, a recognition of their informal status as members of the crew. For reasons I won't go into, we named our Paul. When Paul stopped working, we were both disappointed and heartbroken, like we'd lost a close friend. After we had rigged up a makeshift steering aid out of a bungee cord, we decided to name it Paul Jr. in his honor. Incidentally, Paul Jr. was quite a good helmsman himself, at least as long as we were heading upwind. Sadly he too succumbed to the weather, snapping in half after too many hours rubbing the wheel. Now we're on to a sail tie named Paul Jr. II.

So here we are, one last night at sea before our triumphant landfall on mainland Japan. As per my usual pre-arrival ritual, I've started enumerating all the things I can't wait to do after we're docked. Drinking sake, eating sushi, and catching up on the past week's Daily Shows are high on the list. And after a few days it's off to America and a welcome retreat from the sailing lifestyle.

Seeing as I don't expect to be doing any sailing for the next few months, I'm going to put this journal on hiatus. It's been a great way to pass the time and to share some thoughts, so thanks for reading. But I need a break from that too, so I'll write again when (/if) we return to the high seas.

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! Hard to believe it's been three and a half months since my last journal entry. The time has flown by like nothing, and at the same time, quite a lot has happened. It's going to be another couple months before Kallisti sets sail again, but I wanted to provide a mid-summer update.

First of all, I should go over what our plans are, since as of the last entry (and even up until a month ago) quite a lot was up in the air. The short story is, we're going to try and make it to Boston as originally planned. The details are a little more complicated: because of the West Pacific typhoon season, we don't really want to leave Tokyo much earlier than October. Besides which, I'm going to Burning Man in early September. And since we were going to be waiting anyway, Ted's got a job for a few months in New York.

We've penciled in October 10th as our departure date from Yumenoshima, the marina we're staying in. For most of August and September the boat will be there unattended, while Ted and I enjoy some stateside shore leave. I'm scheduled to get back on September 26th, and Ted a few days thereafter, whereupon we'll tackle some lingering maintenance tasks (on which, more below), stock up on provisions, and set out on the next leg.

From Tokyo, we have a few choices on specifics, but we'll be heading generally towards Singapore. We'll want to reach there before the end of 2010, so we can head across the Indian Ocean as soon as the favorable northeast winter monsoon sets in. It's important to finish before the monsoon switches to the southwest, because once this happens it will become virtually impossible to sail into the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea beyond. But if we leave Singapore on time in early January, we should make the Red Sea no later than the end of March, and then slog our way up to the Suez by late April.

It's hard to take any planning past that point very seriously right now, as there are so many unknowns and lurking obstacles between here and there. But insofar as there's a plan, it's to wait out the Atlantic hurricane season somewhere in the Mediterranean and then do the last couple passages in October of 2011. This will provide another nice summer to relax and do some (non-aquatic) travel.

As I mentioned, we didn't really finalize these plans until pretty recently. In fact, for a while we were leaning towards selling the boat somewhere around Japan and calling that good enough. Since this was a pretty major turning point in the trip, I want to do it full justice and be clear about the arguments on both sides.

For the first month or so after we reached Japan, we didn't really think about next steps at all. I took my three week trip back to the states, and found myself coming to terms with some serious culture shock. Everything from my "old life" seemed so familiar, and yet somehow very alien, as though I was a completely different person seeing someone else's memories. At the same time I missed it all terribly, and remembered how much I'd been enjoying myself.

Returning to Tokyo in early May, I reflected that I felt like I had largely achieved most of what I'd set out to achieve by undertaking this adventure in the first place. I had thoroughly shaken up my world, grown and matured in a lot of ways, and achieved the (in my opinion pretty damn impressive) feat of sailing across the Pacific Ocean. At the same time, seven months with not much else to think about had generated a lot of ideas of things to work on, projects to undertake, new directions for my life. I came to the conclusion that if we stopped the trip, I would be more than happy to jump on to some new crazy endeavor back on land, and I said so to Ted.

Ted, on the other hand, expressed immediate resistance to the idea of stopping. I don't want to put words in his mouth, but from our conversations I understood his feeling to be: we set out to sail around the world, and anything less is admitting defeat. I have to admit that this argument strikes a bit of a chord with me, because I'm somewhat of a perennial starter. I've always had a tendency to take on ambitious goals, give them 110%, and then just when they're starting to seem possible I lose interest and jump to something else. But, on the other hand, blindly pursuing a goal just because you said you would is a fool's errand; plans are a framework for decision-making, not an end unto themselves. In the end, we decided to both think on it for a while longer, and return to the discussion in June.

Meanwhile, living in Tokyo was proving to be a very enlightening experience. In fact, all my time in Japan, now totaling over 4 months, has been fascinating. Being completely immersed in a culture so fundamentally different provides so much perspective on everything from culture, to nutrition, to language, to philosophy. For anyone who has never traveled abroad, I can't recommend it enough. And I don't just mean a one or two week vacation either: to really appreciate it you have to live amongst the people, not just visit. I've found it to be so transformative that I'm seriously looking for a way to make 2, 3, or 6 month overseas travel a regular part of my life, once this trip's over.

Another complication in my decision-making process is Naomi. Naomi is the girl I met in Chichijima when we stopped there in March. I didn't mention her in this journal at the time, for a variety of reasons. There are lots of people reading this journal that I've never even met. And the idea of having a girlfriend on a tiny remote island who doesn't even speak English (although she's learning now) just seemed too crazy, too fantastic, to take seriously. Plus, as those who know me will attest, I'm the last person you would call a romantic, so the whole situation is a little embarrassing (as I'm told the story is quite appallingly romantic).

After living in Tokyo for a month, I went back to Chichijima (this time by the Japanese 25-hour ferry ride) to see Naomi again. Both of us had spent the intervening two months trying to learn each others' languages, and this time things went wonderfully. Falling in love with somebody you can only minimally talk with is a strange experience, and I couldn't help but think about what pre-language homo sapiens' courtships must have been like. But there it was, we were falling in love with each other, and I decided "Screw it, I might as well live in the fantasy world and see what happens." Trouble was, if Ted and I decided to go to Boston after all, it could be another year before Naomi could see each other again.

As June rolled by, the time was coming for us to bite the bullet and agree on a plan. I laid out my thoughts to Ted as plainly as I could: I'd prefer to stop, for all the above reasons, but I also understand the appeal of finishing the trip. There's no doubt in my mind that if and when we sail into Boston, it will be a truly amazing feeling, and everything will have been worth it. So, I left the decision to him. After a few days' contemplation, he replied back and said: let's do it.

Because some people (including e.g. our parents) may question the wisdom of this choice, I want to clarify that I really am 100% behind it. Yes it will be hard, yes there will be some dangers, but that's been true from the start. There's no way to like what we've done so far and at the same time deny the appeal of continuing onwards. There are some logistical downsides to the plan, from my perspective, but over the past month I've thought through most of them and come up with reasonable compromises. The one thing I really feel bad about is leaving Naomi for so long, but she's been wonderfully understanding, so we'll just have to cross our fingers and hope things work out. In the end, that's all anyone can ever do anyway, so there's no point in worrying.

Having made the decision to keep going, my attention turned backed to logistics. Kallisti got a little beat up on the Pacific crossing, resulting in a laundry list of to-do items small and large. After some considerable deliberation we gave in and spent the $4000 to pick up a replacement windvane, which is sitting in parts in the cabin right now. Its assembly is the primary task awaiting us when we get back in late September. The broken main traveler has been professionally repaired via the installation of a large steel plate. A few days of troubleshooting with a multimeter revealed a corroded wire as the cause of our automatic bilge pump woes, and we've installed a temporary fix to keep the boat floating in our absence, but re-running new wire will be another day or two's work before we set sail again.

The good news is, we're 8000 miles more experienced than we were last time. In fact, looking back on how totally unprepared we were when we first crawled out past Cape Flattery into the Pacific, I find the picture almost laughable. I know enough to know we're still novices in a lot of respects, and I'm certain that we'll hit our share of disasters of all sorts and degrees. But I'm excited about the challenge, and looking forward to another year of dazzling new places, people, and experiences. I'm even planning to take up celestial navigation, just for kicks.

Right now I'm taking advantage of my last little bit of time in Japan to explore Hokkaido, which thus far has been beautiful (if a bit cloudy and rainy). Next week I'll return to Tokyo, to meet Naomi when she comes up from Chichijima. Together, we're flying to Seattle, and she's going to visit for 17 days before we say goodbye until next spring. Then I'll soak up all the America I can for another month and a half, and we'll be back on the road. I plan to resume regular entries in October, but until then, I'm going to enjoy my summer - I hope you do too!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone,

Well, after a nice 6 months' rest- er, I mean, 6 months' traveling and learning Japanese, I'm starting to get back into sailing mode. Route planning is under way, gear is being repaired/purchased, and I'm studying celestial navigation. It's getting pretty exciting!

Meanwhile, today happens to be the 1 year anniversary of Kallisti's setting sail from Seattle. To mark the occasion, I thought I'd send out scans of the article that KAZI magazine printed about us:

If anyone can translate, we'd love to hear from you! (I'm trying, but my Japanese is a long ways from fluent still...)

Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[Hello again Kallisti followers!

After an eventful six month stay in Yumenoshima marina, the time has finally come for Kallisti to resume her westward voyage. Having received our (mission-critical) last box of Costco supplies today, we're planning to depart tomorrow morning, Japanese time. Our tentative route will follow the Japanese coastline westward for a little ways, and then strike south across the infamous Kuroshio current before heading for Amami-oshima, a mid-sized island northeast of Okinawa. Of course, as always, our plans may change depending on weather and whim.

As before, we'll be posting SPOT updates roughly daily, starting when we leave port in the morning. Assuming we manage to connect with the SailMail station in Brunei we'll also try to send an e-mail or two, but given the distance we might not be in range until a little later in our approach to Singapore.

I also plan to resume my journal, and will hopefully send out a fresh batch of updates once we arrive at our next port.

Until then, best wishes to everyone!

Cheers,
Kevin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Six months of shore leave later, we're back on the open ocean at least. We left Yumenoshima marina yesterday morning, almost a week later than planned and very ready to be moving on. I had a wonderful time in Tokyo (and at my various other stops since April), but once you know you're leaving there comes a time when you want to just get on with it. I'm happy to be sailing again.

It's an amusing quirk of the human condition that we make almost all of our really critical life decisions from a position of near-total ignorance regarding their consequences. Back in late December, as Ted and I floated along east of Chuuk and debated our newly conceived plan of detouring to Japan, there's no way we could have known how it would turn out. In the end, it was hope, guesswork, and gut feel.

Now that detour is pretty much over, and we're headed southwest to rejoin our originally scheduled route. Once we reach Singapore we'll be right where we would have been without the change in plans, except a year older, and hopefully wiser. There are still a couple thousand miles to go, and I don't want to speak for Ted, but in my mind the change was a smashing success. I don't know what I was hoping for, if I even had anything in mind besides a rest from sailing, but things turned out better than I would have ever imagined.

Aside from the many amazing and interesting people we met on the way North to Tokyo, and the awesome places we saw, I'm extremely grateful to have gotten a chance to immerse myself in the Japanese culture. Even if only for a few months, it was quite an enlightening and thought-provoking experience. Ever since my month in Australia and New Zealand in 2005, I had hoped to one day do some extended travel again, as I'd found it to be an irreplaceable way of learning and growing. But in Japan, I found the culture so different and so fascinating that I doubt I'll be able to resist returning many times in the years to come. And as I've written before, learning the language has also been rewarding, and I look forward to continuing my study over the coming months.

The detour has also been very successful as a time to rest and re-energize. Where, in April, I was feeling more than a little run down and generally unenthusiastic, I'm now more excited about this trip and life in general than I can ever remember being. Time ashore has given me enough perspective to really appreciate what we're doing, and to rediscover the unquenchable thirst for the horizon that pushed me out of Seattle in the first place. The world is waiting, and I'm ready to take it, or at least have a damn good time trying.

Anyway, all that aside, the last 30 hours have brought the expected physical and mental readjustment to cruising life. There wasn't much wind yesterday so we motored out of Tokyo Bay (about 8 hours) before tentatively putting some sails up. Since then a few breezes have come and gone, and all in all our progress has been gradual but steady. I find myself slowly remembering all this, as though from a past life. "Ah, that's right, days on end sitting around waiting for wind. It's all coming back to me now."

As per my previous passages, this one has started off with some mild stomach and headache discomfort; not bad enough to merit the word "seasick" but annoying nonetheless. I took a nap this afternoon though, and since then I've been feeling mostly better. Fortunately the weather's been fairly pleasant, other than the lack of wind, and the almost nightly torrential downpours that had been hitting us the past two weeks at Yumenoshima haven't (yet) chased after us. The temperature hasn't gotten too cold yet despite it being late October, but the nights are still chilly and I'm very much looking forward to getting back down south.

And of course, it wouldn't be cruising without some equipment issues. We dealt with (or failed to deal with) too many things in Tokyo to even hope to remember them all, but here are some highlights:

-The automatic bilge pump has been rewired, and so far, seems to be working.
-The broken main traveler was repaired professionally.
-Our old windvane, Paul, was removed and replaced by a brand new one. Paul II is steering diligently as I'm writing.
-Our depth sounder had mysteriously stopped working upon my return in September. After checking all wiring and fuses and finding no issue, we removed and opened the unit itself, only to find a half pint of standing water inside. Much troubleshooting and several e-mails to the manufacturer later it's now working fine, with the final repair coming in clutch an hour before our departure yesterday.
-The connection from our GPS to our cockpit chartplotter is dead, apparently due to corrosion on the plug. We've ordered a replacement cable shipped ahead to meet us in Okinawa, but until then we're making do without. This means having to read our position off our backup plotter down below (this one has no detailed charts for this area), then manually entering it above. Annoying while navigating near land, but now that we're in open ocean it's less of an issue.

Naturally there are many other aspects of this lifestyle that we're rapidly remembering: uncomfortable sleep, checking weather, sending SPOTs, dealing with boredom, eating canned food, etc. etc. I've written about it all before, and probably will again, so for now I'll leave it at that. Kallisti's back on the water, folks; let's see where the wind takes her.

		<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, another part of sailing I had forgotten about: storms. This one is probably the worst we've seen so far. It started on Monday morning, and has been gradually building for two whole days. Along with the usual wind and waves, it's brought torrential rain, especially over the past 12 hours. I'm able to take the time to write this now because Ted and I finally gave up on fighting the storm and now we're lying ahull - more or less a last-ditch method of riding out rough weather, and one we'd never had to resort to before. I celebrated the occasion with a (small) glass of Bowmore single malt scotch.

Monday saw some particularly nasty waves, as we struck south across the infamous Kuroshio Current. This 50+ mile wide, 2 knot flow of seawater pushed east against the storm's southwest-blowing wind to create what were probably the biggest waves we've been in. Wave height is notoriously difficult to estimate, but Ted and I both thought several were over 20 feet. They were certainly rolling us pretty good, with our cockpit clinometer regularly over 30d and more than a few times topping 40d.

It was during the night on Monday that we buried Paul I. I guess I forgot to mention that after we removed the old windvane, we kept the rusted, weathered frame on board, intending to give our trusted crewmate a proper farewell at sea. So, after an hour of fighting to reef sails during one of the first really serious bouts of the storm, we paused to throw our fallen comrade into the Kuroshio. A few respectful words were said, and then Paul T. Monitor was sent to spend his afterlife at home in the sea. It was a touching moment.

One fortunate aspect of this storm has been the favorable wind direction, which has allowed us to run off downwind and keep making solid progress south and west. Even now, with no sails up and at Poseidon's mercy, we're drifting towards Amami-oshima at a knot or two. Add to that a surprisingly comfortable temperature and the situation seems a lot less terrible than it could be.

I have a lot more I'd like to write about, but there's still a storm out there, and I should be taking this chance to rest while I can. Lying ahull should be pretty safe unless the storm gets substantially worse, but you never know. So until things ease up we'll just cross our fingers and wait. I have three different good luck charms from friends and well-wishers hanging over my bunk, and I'm grateful for all of them right now. Hopefully, I'll write again under sunny skies...

		<description><![CDATA[Well, no sunny skies yet. In fact, we haven't seen the sun (or stars, or any clear sky) since Tokyo Bay. This storm has lingered with us for over four days, and shows no signs of letting up. Based on a conversation over the satellite phone yesterday, I'm beginning to think all this weather is a distant effect from a large typhoon that passed south of Taiwan. We saw the forecast for the typhoon before we left, but because it was 1000+ miles away we didn't worry too much. Maybe that was naive; or maybe this is unrelated, but whatever the case, it sure has brought a lot of wind, waves, and rain.

After lying ahull for a few hours during my last entry, the storm subsided ever so slightly, and we decided to try running under bare poles (i.e. no sails up but steering the boat dead downwind, using just the force of the wind on the masts and hull for speed). We've stayed with this for most of the last two days, except when conditions picked back up to the point where Paul II couldn't hold the downwind course anymore. Astonishingly, we've been consistently clocking 5-6 knots even on bare poles, and so we're still making halfway decent time towards Amami-oshima. Once again, I'm very glad the wind direction is at least in our favor.

Rough weather is, I think, always a bit of a test for any sailor. It's partly a test of skill, and significantly of physical stamina, but mostly of mental endurance. Finding the right mindset to just ride it out is no small feat, nor is keeping yourself there as the hours and days wear on. I suspect every individual's ways of coping are different, too, with Ted's attitude definitely contrasting against my own. I'll be the first to admit that this is one of the toughest and most draining parts of sailing for me, and it's a continual struggle to keep a positive attitude. I'm trying to remind myself that this is exactly the sort of character-building experience I wanted to get from this trip, and that I'll be stronger for it when we've finished. Maybe that's just rationalization or wishful thinking, but it still helps.

One of my coping mechanisms is to turn inward and spend a lot of time doing some deep soul-searching. When everything in life is going well, it can be hard to really step back and ask hard questions of yourself. Sometimes it takes a little adversity, fear, and loneliness to peel back the layers of ego and look in an honest mirror. I know, intellectually, that I'm a person chocked full of flaws, failings, and limitations. But it's only at times like this when I can truly admit those flaws, take ownership of them, and make peace with who I am (and who I'm not). While it's not the most pleasant thing, it's a valuable spiritual experience, and one I'm trying to make the most of.

This prolonged rough weather has also reminded me of how good we humans are at adapting. After 4 days, I'm starting to get used to things being this way, and gradually what had seemed nightmarish has now become merely annoying and unpleasant. If anything, the biggest lingering irritation is not knowing how much longer this will last. But with only about 220 miles to go, even if the weather persists we should reach port in a couple days. And after 4 days of wind, rain, and rough seas, what's another 2 more? That is another coping mechanism I've been trying to harness: reminding myself that all inconvenience and suffering is temporary. Sooner or later the weather will clear up, and until then I just have to wait it out.

So, on that note, back to waiting I go. We'll see if I can soul-search my way into sunlight this time.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all,

What a trip.  Hit the worst weather we've seen yet, call it a force 9.  We were forced ahull twice and spent about 2 full days running at 6+ knots under bare poles.  I've never seen waves like these before.  Horizontal rain and foam whipping by so fast it stung to face it.  At one point we were actually taking in winch handles and the like in preparation for a knockdown, but luckily it never came to that.  Thankfully the wind was out of the NE.  I don't think we saw the sun for more than about 2 hours total in the entire week's trip. 

If you've not a sailor, there's pretty much no way that words can do justice to the experience, but try to imagine it blowing so hard that you're forced to just lie in a ball on the ground and hope you don't get picked up and rolled over.  Meanwhile these 20+ foot waves are just going to town. 

For all that - it was incredible.  Exhilarating.  Awesome in the literal sense.  I need a shower so, so badly.

		<description><![CDATA[Seconded on the shower front.

We didn't know it at the time, but apparently this was the 1000-miles-distant effects of typhoon Megi. Wikipedia tells me it was the strongest typhoon of 2010, and one of the strongest of the 21st century. From a bragging rights perspective, I'm glad we can say we were out at sea during it, but I'm also very glad we were as far away as we were. Just the outer reaches were plenty to convince me I never want to be near the real thing.

Kevin

P.S. I have a few journal entries that I managed to scratch out during the storm, but probably won't get around to posting them until we reach Okinawa (unless I find wifi someplace here).]]></description>

http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/typh5.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Pacific_typhoon_season#Tropical_Storm_Chaba_.28Katring.29

We had been considering getting out of here today and heading straight for Okinawa, but that plan's not looking very wise at the moment. So we'll ride things out here until the forecast clears up. Hopefully we can find a decent dock to tie off to, or things could get interesting... 

On the bright side, I finally found a shower this morning - it's the little things that make me happy :)

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, the last few days have not gone as expected. Here I am sitting on board Kallisti, seriously wondering if she'll survive the week, so soon after having made it through the last passage's ordeal. But we'll get back to that; first I might as well fill in events since my last entry. Besides, every writer knows foreshadowing and then digression heightens the reader's anticipation.

The strongest of the winds had subsided by Saturday, but there was still quite a blow chasing us, and the swells built up over the days of gale had become very impressive. The fear and anxiety of earlier in the week had given way to irritation, exhaustion, and finally exasperation; it seemed like we'd never get a break. The rain had eased off to intermittent sprinkles and showers, but it was enough to prevent all of our soaked clothing and bedding from drying out. All in all another fantastic day; though I have to admit some of the surfing was really exhilarating.

I went to bed that night having pretty much abandoned hope of clear weather, but took consolation in knowing we were on pace to make port Sunday afternoon, whatever the skies and sea had to say about it. So it was a surprise and relief to wake up to bright sunshine and a gentle breeze. My spirits rebounded laudably, and weren't phased even when we had to switch to motoring 20 miles out to combat a westerly shift in the wind. In fact, I even volunteered to hand-steer the 5 hours into Naze port, and let Ted nap himself back into a more normal land-based schedule. It really wasn't so bad either: I usually loathe hand-steering for extended periods, but feeling like we'd conquered nature's wrath put me on top of the world. Little did I know it was only her first volley.

And so, motoring into a new harbor for the first time in over half a year, Ted and I easily slid back into our familiar arrival routine. Which is to say, we drove around looking for someplace that seemed good. A small harbor at the far end of the bay, right in the heart of the small city of Naze, presented itself nicely. So we tied off and looked for someone to talk to. Unfortunately it being Sunday this proved difficult, and eventually we settled for dinner and a net cafe before calling it a night. We figured if there was a problem with our location someone would be along on Monday morning to let us know.

This time of year, the sun rises in Amami-oshima around 6 am. It was not long after that (maybe a little before) that the fish auction started right outside our boat. Ted somehow slept through the whole thing, but I got up and watched, waiting for a chance to ask about our docking situation. I wasn't waiting long. Soon after the auctions were efficiently concluded I was met and informed that we absolutely could not stay where we were. Apparently we were blocking an unloading area for fishing boats. About an hour after that conversation (during which time I managed to sneak in a shower at a nearby hotel, thank god) Japanese customs showed up. Oh, Japanese customs. Nice guys, very friendly, but they are bureaucracy incarnate. We filled out forms for an hour, even though we were already cleared through customs in Tokyo (and Chichijima before that). This urgent paperwork concluded, they told us we had to move the boat to a new spot immediately. As in, they pointed to a spot on a map, and then cast off our lines for us.

Once we'd shifted to their new spot, a lovely 20 minute walk away from town, another several rounds of paperwork awaited. By this point Ted and I were feeling pretty unenthusiastic about the whole place, and were seriously debating just leaving for Okinawa that afternoon. It was during this discussion that we first got word, via one of the customs officers who seemed to be nesting on the dock next to us, that a typhoon was approaching Okinawa.

By this time we had managed to read up on the weather from the previous week and learned about typhoon Megi. Apparently it was a category 5 supertyphoon, one of the worst on record. Even at a distance of a thousand miles it had caused us a pretty miserable week, so the word "typhoon" still had me a bit jumpy. At first I thought there was some translation issue going on, and he was talking about the one we'd just made it through. "Yes," I said, "we were in it, it was awful." I refused to believe another was headed our way already, and in late October no less, purportedly past the high-risk typhoon season. But eventually he brought a printed map of the predicted storm track from the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) website, and the reality sank in. Having survived a typhoon's fringe effects at sea, we were going to get a shore-side view of the full thing.

That afternoon the coast guard had us move a second time, to what they believed would be the safest place. As far as Ted and I can tell it's only marginally better at best, and still far from adequate to feel safe from harm. But there aren't really many options. This island just isn't a great typhoon shelter for a small boat like us, and it's our unlucky roll of the dice that we're stuck here. So, we've done the best we can to prepare the boat for the worst. We put out just about every line we have, except a few reserves to try and replace or reinforce when and if we can. Ted scavenged a half dozen old tires from a nearby scrap heap, which we've secured to the boat and dock to try and absorb shocks as the waves drive us into the concrete.

Meanwhile, I keep checking the forecast, watching the storm's track and intensity. So far the news just gets worse and worse, as if this were some Kallisti-seeking missile honing in on its target. As of this afternoon the winds are expected to reach 80 knots by Friday, with gusts to 115. I have to confess, I really don't know right now whether or not the boat, in its current docking, can survive. Maybe after the storm it will be fine, and it will seem silly that I was worried. Or equally possible, it will seem silly that I had any hope to begin with. Only time will tell.

As someone who firmly subscribes to the "Always Look On the Bright Side of Life" philosophy, I can't help but laugh at the situation. As frustrating and disheartening as it would be to have the dream of this voyage literally smashed to pieces, in some ways it would be a fitting conclusion. If you fail because of an act of God, nobody can fault you for not trying. And if nothing else, it promises to be quite a show, which in the end is all you can ask for out of life. So let's get on with it already, raise the curtain and show us what you've got in store!

		<description><![CDATA[Seems like we got a lucky break at the last minute, and Chaba turned eastward earlier than the forecasts predicted. We may also have gotten more protection than we expected from being in the lee (downwind side) of a mountain. Either way, on board Kallisti it was pretty much a non-event; a little rain, some occasional moderate gusts, but nothing worse than any other rainy day. With all the time and effort we put into storm-readying the boat, it was almost a little disappointing. Almost.

Things are already pretty much clear here though, and we're still not that happy with our docking location 20 minutes' drive from town, so we're thinking we'll head out ASAP. We should have good winds all the way to Okinawa, a quick couple days' sail. Talk to you from there!

		<description><![CDATA[We just arrived in Okinawa, after an (almost) uneventful 38 hour passage. Normally my only thoughts after landfall are food, internet, and/or sleep. But it was a short trip, and I have to wait for the marina office to open before we can check in anyway, so I might as well write about some stuff.

The typhoon we were expecting in Amami definitely fell far short of what we had been fearing. We never even bothered evacuating the boat, and the worst damage we saw was some mud from all our lines getting the cockpit dirty. I still don't know what would have happened if the purported 80-100 knot winds had shown up, or whether our boat would have survived. Hopefully I'll never have to find out. If nothing else, it was a good opportunity to practice securing to a dock, and to scavenge some lines and tired (Ted practically filled the v-berth with repurposed trash).

Now that we're in Okinawa I'm looking forward to doing some shopping. Specifically, to replacing my camera and mp3 player, both of which broke (again) on the trip from Tokyo. I guess amidst all the other typhoon talk I forgot to mention the continued havoc being wrought on our electronics. The depth sounder went again, although it seems to be the same issue of leaking in water somehow. And the newly repaired cockpit chartplotter, which was already sans GPS-input, stopped turning on entirely. It's probably just corrosion on the cable, just like the GPS issue, but it still renders the unit useless. At this point we may just give up on it altogether and make do with the spare (or, god forbid, paper charts).

And on the subject of electronics, we had one lovely little surprise on the way into Ginowan marina this morning. Literally a quarter mile from shore and the end of our passage, as we motored into the harbor entrance, I smelled something burning. Ted jumped down below to look, and indeed there was a small fire in the vicinity of the engine oil filter. Fortunately our fire extinguisher worked like a charm, and equally fortunately, the engine kept running and let us get safely to the dock. Hooray for our first fire on Kallisti!

Except the story doesn't quite end there. It seems that some wires got caught in the fire (or maybe they started it, we don't really know) and melted. Now, none of the electronics on the ship are working. If we're lucky it's just a blown fuse or two somewhere, and a couple wires to replace. If we're unlucky we may end up redoing the entire electrical system. I don't want to think about what that would do to our schedule, or our budget. So for now, I won't think about it - tomorrow will be fun.

Anyway, that's life aboard Kallisti: it's always something. All we can do it try to keep up.

		<description><![CDATA[So much for lucky breaks.  We had good winds and a nice quick sail down to Okinawa, until this morning, when our engine caught fire while coming into port.  That was exciting.  We're still assessing the damages, but at a minimum the entire electrical system on the boat is down.  There's a big tangled mess of burned wire, melted rubber and extinguisher residue where the fire occurred.

I think the engine itself is more or less fine - w/ possibly a faulty oil filter - but we can't turn it on to check because the starter battery and/or wiring is out.  So we're stuck here in Ginowan until we can get this sorted.

		<description><![CDATA[With a couple comparatively quiet and stress-free days under my belt, I thought I'd jot down a quick update on things. For the most part, we've settled into Ginowan marina nicely, and I might even be close to enjoying myself for the first time since we left Tokyo. The marina has showers (for only 150 yen!) and free Wi-Fi, neither of which are life-necessities but both of which really make the day-to-day lifestyle a lot more pleasant. The surrounding neighborhood isn't quite as lively as we'd hoped, but there are a smattering of restaurants, bars, and shops within a 20 or 30 minute walk.

Yesterday I made it out to a big electronics store and bought a replacement camera and mp3 player, the latter of which is very important because it will let me get back to the audio book I was halfway through. Hopefully I can get to work on uploading some pictures from Tokyo and our first passage pretty soon.

We also found an electrician to come look at the damage from our little fire. The news isn't great, but about as good as could be reasonably expected. It seems like there was an electrical short somewhere, as one of our batteries is totally dead. We don't really know whether the short started the fire, or vice versa. Either way we need to replace the battery and the wiring, as well as the starter motor, which was badly damaged. It's going to be something like a couple thousand dollars, all told, but at least it should be wrapped up within a week or two. The expense is painful but we knew we'd have problems along the way, and $2000 is a lot better than $5000 or $10,000. And it shouldn't have too drastic of an effect on our schedule, which given the tightness of some of our timelines, is pretty significant.

It's also nice that we're getting it fixed professionally, which means that aside from the background stress and anxiety, it doesn't keep us from going out and exploring Okinawa. Hopefully over the next few days we'll get a chance to wander around a bit, meet some people, and generally enjoy the "traveling" portion of traveling by sailboat. After what have been a pretty trying couple weeks, it will be good to actually have fun for a while before heading back out to sea.

That said, as fun as writing in this journal is, an island awaits so I'm going to sign off. More to come, soon enough!

http://www.flickr.com/photos/55615515@N02/ 

I'm hoping to get some pictures of Okinawa, our marina, and some of the fire damage, as well as my experiment in not shaving or cutting my hair for 3 months, and post them in the next few days. Hopefully it will stop raining here, because (like most places) Okinawa is a lot prettier in sunshine.

Enjoy!

		<description><![CDATA[Repairs on the damage caused by the fire were completed yesterday. All told they replaced our starter motor and starter battery, our ignition push-button, our main battery switch, the starter solenoid, two fried terminals, and several wires. The cost came out to a little over $2000, which is far from small change but not nearly as bad as it could have been. The cost in time was also minimal, and I find myself feeling like things turned out as good as we could have expected.

With the boat back in working order we're planning to set sail tomorrow morning. Only a few small matters remain to take care of here (such as rounding up and delivering JPY200,000 in cash - credit or checks are no good). Okinawa seems like a nice enough place, but our location is remote enough to make it hard to really enjoy, and a literal world of beautiful tropical islands lies waiting for us.

Over the past few days we discussed options for our exact path between here and Singapore. With the time we lost to this fire mishap, it no longer seemed to make sense to visit any other Japanese islands as we'd previously been planning. Moreover, we found out that Vietnam requires visitors to get a visa at an embassy or consulate before arriving, which we obviously won't be able to do. Considering those and other factors, we've settled on heading to the Philippines and making our way along the eastern edge of the South China Sea. There are some navigational and weather advantages to this route also, but I won't bore you with the details.

We've been in Japan for a long time now. With our departure finally in sight (in fact, less than 24 hours from now), I'm getting pretty excited to e someplace totally new again. There is something very comforting about familiarity with the culture, language, or customs of a new place as you sail into port, but it trades off with an anticipation and excitement that reach their peak only when you have no idea what to expect. And even our most obscure, unresearched stops don't hold a candle to what explorers 500 years ago must have experienced. Sometimes I can't help but be jealous of them.

For our first stop, we've picked out a lovely-looking little Philippine island in the middle of the Luzon Strait. It has a 4-digit population and single-digit length in miles, both good indicators in our past experience. The question will be whether or not we're allowed to enter the country there, since customs can often be quite obstinate about that sort of thing. But it's too tempting to just pass by, so we'll head there and see what happens. Worst case, they'll make us leave, in which case we'll head onwards and find some other beautiful Philippine island to spend our money at.

In other news, we've at least temporarily resolved our propane situation. I can't remember whether or not I mentioned this before; so many of my journal entries are written when I'm tired, and I never bother to go back and read them later. Anyway, since Tokyo we've been trying to get our propane tank refilled, but due to a difference in connectors it's proven utterly impossible. Before we left Tokyo a very generous American friend we'd made at the marina kindly gifted us a small portable stove to use instead of our shipboard one, and for which we could buy fuel canisters anywhere in Japan. Unfortunately, we had been unable to get the thing working, and by last week we were starting to acclimate to the idea of eating only cold food until we hit a country that used US tank fittings.

So, it was a great relief when another kindly fellow, whom we met at a bar in Ginowan, gifted us a second portable stove. Apparently everyone in the country has one of these lying around. What's more, that same day I finally deciphered the (Japanese-only) instructions on the first one, and got it working too. So now we have two stoves and 10+ canisters of fuel, and can look forward to at least another month or two of cooked meals before the problem resurfaces. Hopefully we can get our main tank refilled by then.

There isn't much else to say, for now. The weather forecast shows strong winds right out of the northeast all week and into next, which should make for a fast (if less than ideally comfortable) trip. I don't expect it to take more than 4 or 5 days, but I'm sure I'll write again before then.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 

The repairs on our engine and electrical system are finished, so we're going to head out this morning. Our next planned stop is a small island in the Philippines called Batan, in between Luzon (the main Philippine landmass) and Taiwan. The forecast looks pretty favorable, so we should make it there in 4 or 5 days. Depending on potential customs restrictions we may or may not be allowed to stay, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 

And with that, we're off again!

		<description><![CDATA[One of the downsides of buying a new camera in Japan is that all of the menus and options are in Japanese. By a regrettable (but, in hindsight, predictable) series of events, this led to Ted's accidentally deleting all of our pictures from Okinawa. These included shots of the marina, the damage from the engine fire, and some good ones of Ted atop the mast while he worked on adjusting our spreaders. Now, all gone forever. Oh well, as the Japanese say, "shou ga nai": there's nothing to be done about it.

The weather, at least, has been great so far. We hadn't really had genuinely good sailing weather since leaving Tokyo, so I'm glad we finally caught a break. It's still chillier than I'd like, particularly during the nights, but otherwise we have a steady 15 knot wind at our backs and a pretty smooth downwind ride. And some clear skies have at least been giving me a chance to play with my new sextant! So far my attempts have met with mixed results, but I'm gradually getting the hang of it, and I'm cautiously optimistic that someday we could do a passage entirely by the sun, moon, and stars.

I'm just starting out another long and boring 8 hour watch shift, so I think I'll indulge in a bit of a verbose entry today. I've been putting a lot of day-to-day stuff in here recently, but in the interest of making this journal mean something to me years from now, I want to record more than the matter-of-fact events. For people who read this just for the story, feel free to skip ahead.

What I want to talk about is a question I get asked pretty frequently: "What do you do with all that time?" Actually it's not this question, but its usual follow-up. My answer to this first question usually boils down to "eat, sleep, read, and think a lot." So the follow-up is, "What do you think about?"

I have so much time to think that, in truth, there probably are few things that don't come up from time to time. My past, my future, my friends, current events, the boat, the weather, our route, and what foods and movies and I'd kill to eat and watch respectively are certainly frequent topics. But I have an intellectually curious nature, and a number of more general (if not necessarily more profound) subjects consistently attract my attention as I while away the hours listening to the wind and waves' music.

Ocean cruising lends itself to deep thought for reasons beyond just the free time it affords. Specifically, it allows one to see modern society from the outside, in a way all but impossible anywhere else in our connected, globalized world. Living out here you learn (or perhaps remember is the right word) that there are no rules except the ones nature imposes on us. All of the laws, customs, traditions, social norms, expectations, pressures, and taboos are nothing more than arbitrary conventions that humanity has imposed upon ourselves. None of it has to be that way; it just happens to be that way. And in many cases, the reasons for it happening to be that way (if there are any) are outdated, based on faulty assumptions, narrow-minded, or all of the above.

I don't want to come off as an anarchist or anything. I'm a huge fan of civilization, and clearly it's done some wonderful things for us. But we are far too quick to accept its failings simply because we can't be bothered to imagine anything different. So, I spend a lot of time out here trying to remedy that, at least at a personal level. In a way it's ironic: utterly withdrawing from civilization in order to understand and improve it. But, in the same way that your friends always know you should break up with your girlfriend three months before you do, an outside opinion can be valuable.

Being a lifelong unapologetic nerd, I also spend a lot of time thinking about science and technology. Some of this is spurred by reading; I just finished Carl Sagan's Cosmos, which kicked off many interesting thought trains. But a lot is reflecting on the general start of human knowledge. We live in extraordinarily fascinating times: within the last few decades, humanity has started to cross several thresholds at once. First, we've developed a genuine understanding of what we are and how we got here, via evolutionary theory, molecular biology, neuroscience, and many other related fields. And second, we've created technology that is improving via a feedback loop, such that fundamental shifts in lifestyle are happening within single generations. Both of these phenomena are so mind-boggling that I feel like I could reflect on either one for days at a time.

With all of the above swimming around in my brain, I inevitably get drawn into thinking about our future. And when I say "our" I really mean "Our," as in humanity's, future. (In fact, in light of potential progress in artificial intelligence, I might even broaden to "consciousness's future.") One of the social conventions that seems most arbitrary and meaningless to me is that of national identity. Or for that matter, any identity, insofar as it supersedes our shared human identity. The evolutionary understanding I mentioned above, combined with the experiences we've had so far aboard Kallisti, have convinced me of this: people are people. The idea that we should argue, or hate, or kill over some imaginary lines just seems childish and obtuse beyond all measure.

Of course there are positive cultural identities behind many of the world's nations, and that's great. Diversity is an essential element of a strong ecosystem, as basic biology teaches us. But it's possible to have diversity underneath an umbrella of cooperation and mutual respect. Boston and New York can hate each other on the baseball field, but they're not going to go to war over it. I guess what I'm saying is, if we can get Iran to switch from "Death to America" to "Yankees such" I'll be happy.

And if I'm going to pick on countries, I might as well go after religions too. Actually, that's unfair; religions as such don't bother me. But when religions become the basis for identity and thus exclusion, they're every bit as stupid and dangerous as countries. Particularly in the modern information world, it's all too easy for extreme worldviews to infect large populations, and for these groups to become insular and self-reinforcing. I suppose that is the core of what I fear: any worldview that defines "Us" and "Them." Sadly, there are quite a few of these.

Thinking about these things gets me really depressed sometimes. So much suffering is caused by such pointless and needless division, and has been since time immemorial. But I remind myself of the point I started with: it doesn't have to be this way, it just happens to be this way. And with our ever-increasing understanding of our world, our minds, and how and why we think and behave the way we do, there's more hope than ever that we can change. We have a real opportunity to be the generation where humanity turned the corner, if only we have the imagination to envision it and the audacity to try.

So there you have it, that's (a sample of) what I think about as I pass my time at sea. Sorry if I was a bit long-winded or pretentious; both are certainly common faults of mine. I promise to keep my crazy utopian rantings to myself for a while ?

		<description><![CDATA[Not a lot to say today. This trip has been pretty uneventful so far, with winds ranging from 15 knots to high 20s but always out of the northeast. We've continued to make pretty good time, and although it looks like we won't hit my original four day goal, we'll almost certainly be under five. With less than 90 miles to go and a favorable wind, we should reach Batan tomorrow morning.

The one unfortunate aspect of this passage has been the rain. It seems we haven't yet escaped the weather pattern that's been harassing us since Tokyo, as we continue to see steady rains almost every day. Ted and I discussed it this morning and, by our best guess, we've already had more hours of rain in the past month than we did in the entire trip from Seattle to Tokyo. The only silver lining is that, eventually, it will stop.

Other than that, things have been quiet. We had our first avian visitor in a while last night, a cute but cranky white bird that rested on our toerail from sunset through to dawn. These guys make nice company during a lonely night watch, but they also make an absolute mess on the deck. Fortunately the constant pouring rain has already cleaned it up pretty good.

The only equipment issue (so far) is that the little red night light in our binnacle (a cockpit-mounted compass) seems to have stopped working. It's probably just some ancient piece of wiring somewhere that finally decided to give out. This isn't a particularly big deal, but it means you have to use a headlamp or flashlight or something to check your course, which in turn spoils your night vision for a couple minutes afterwards. In the end it's just one more little annoyance, and one more item on the inexhaustible list of things to repair.

So, one more day enjoying the rain, and then we get to find out whether or not Philippine customs will let us visit their island or not. Either way, I hope it's sunny.

		<description><![CDATA[Seems like they're OK with us sticking around here for four or five days, despite this not technically being a valid "port of entry." The contrast between here and Japan is pretty striking; they actually seem like nice, reasonable people, instead of mindless enforcers of ridiculous and arbitrary rules. We didn't even have to fill out a 10-page stack of forms! 

It's also really cheap, and it seems like most people speak English, and the island looks beautiful and worth some exploration. So we're planning to leave on Saturday, unless something comes up.

		<description><![CDATA[It's still raining every day. I'm gradually giving in to the fact that this is just a rainy season around here, and we're probably going to be wet for a while. Oh well, there are worse problems to have to contend with, and it's warm enough to not be that unpleasant. The most annoying thing about it is that it's making it hard to really see and appreciate this lovely little island. I hope I get at least one nice, sunny day to explore a little.

We arrived in Basco on Monday morning. Not terribly surprisingly, the small pier was full and we ended up having to anchor out in the bay. I'm pretty sure I've talked before about the various drawbacks of anchoring: having to dinghy to and from shore, anxiety about your anchor dragging or breaking, etc. But it seems to just be a fact of sailing that the coolest, most unique, most interesting places tend to have the least hospitable facilities. At any rate, at least the bay is pretty well protected from the prevailing NE wind, and the small beach we land our dinghy at is right in the heart of town. What's more, the town itself is less than a mile square, making just about everything an easy 5 or 10 minute walk.

The experience we had with the port authority and coast guard here was so opposite from what we went through in Japan that it bears mentioning. As we walked up the dock we passed by the small shack which served as the port authority's "office." After a friendly greeting and awkward moment, we asked if we needed to do anything to check in. They seemed a little surprised, then shrugged and had us write our names in a little notebook, said thanks, and waved us on. The next building up was the coast guard. They actually asked for a copy of our ship's documents, but only one, instead of the three or four that various Japanese agencies had usually demanded. They confirmed that there is no immigration office here, so technically we're not supposed to stay. But when we asked if it would be alright to stay for just a few days and then check in at the next city south, they conferred briefly and said no problem. "Welcome to the Philippines!"

The fact that almost everyone here speaks at least some English, and many are quite fluent, is another nice perk. I gather that the reason behind this surprising phenomenon is the sheer number of different dialects of Tagalog that exist around the country. Basically, they've adopted Englih as a universal medium for all official and commercial purposes, with the regional dialects relegated to social and day-to-day contacts. All of the signs, advertisements, and instructions (e.g. on ATMs) at least have English, and the majority are English-only. This makes it a very convenient place for an American tourist.

The prices are rather friendly as well. Most of our meals have cost only $4 or $5, with beers running around 75 cents and a hotel room with AC and Wi-Fi for under $20. With no marina fee to pay, Ted and I opted to split one of these rooms, taking turns sleeping out on the boat (like we did in Guam). The total cost of living is so low, and the island so inviting, that it's tempting to want to stay longer. But we have a schedule to keep, and if we hope to be in Singapore in 5 weeks, we've got to keep moving.

Of course something always goes wrong, and this stop has been no exception. This time it was our dinghy's outboard motor, again. Apparently not using it for 8 months, and not changing the oil in over a year, was bad for it. It managed to get us in to shore once or twice, but by Monday afternoon it refused to start. This reduced us to using the paddles to row back and forth, a 10 minute process that gets pretty tiring after the third or fourth trip. But the straw that really broke the camel's back was when one of the oarlocks broke, forcing us to take one paddle each and row our inflatable dinghy like a ridiculous little canoe. With a stiff wind coming at us this was exhausting to do even once, and for one person it might have been impossible to make headway faster than the downwind drift.

So once again we set out in search of a mechanic to fix our outboard. Echoes of Pohnpei loomed in my mind as we walked the streets carrying our poor 2-horsepower Honda around looking helpless. As has so often been the case on our voyages, just when we were starting to feel really put upon by the fates, everything turned out fine. Our new friend Jim, from the local coast guard office, helped us find a mechanic shop. There a group of three kids, all in their early twenties, fixed it right up. They didn't even make fun of us when we sheepishly admitted not only that we hadn't changed the oil, but didn't even know how to check it, nor did we have any more oil for it. They had it working in 30 minutes, and charged us 100 Philippine Pesos, about $2.50. We gave them 1000 and told them if it broke again we'd be back, to which they laughed amiably. Good people.

It looks like the rain is taking a quick breather now, so I'm going to take this opportunity to ride back into shore (yesterday and today are my nights on the boat). With luck the afternoon will be nice enough for some hiking, but if not an evening of 75 cent San Miguels doesn't sound too terrible.

		<description><![CDATA[We've been really enjoying the Batanes, and would gladly stay longer if our schedule allowed, but the time has come to continue onwards for the next port. We're going to head for Palawan, on the southwest end of the Philippines. Our goal is to find some little harbor along the north coast near Puerto Princesa, where we eventually need to make our way to finally clear in through immigration. It's only 700 nm or so, but with lighter winds down in the South China Sea, it might take us the better part of two weeks. I'm crossing my fingers for some lucky breezes and a one week passage, though :)

Nights warm enough to be comfortable in a t-shirt and shorts, despite the breeze, and with spectacular views of the moon and stars. And steady winds carrying us swiftly but comfortably towards our destination. Right this moment, it's hard to remember why we ever sailed north of 23.5 degrees.

To be fair, the winds haven't quite been 100% perfect. This morning, we were totally becalmed for several hours, and eventually opted to motor for a while (despite lingering fears of another fire). We also took the opportunity to go for a quick swim, since without any breeze the tropical sun gets oppressive fast. But by 10:30 or so a gust came up out of the west, and within minutes we were cruising along at 5 knots under sail. And other than that brief windless stretch, the weather really has been almost perfect. We've been able to stay downwind most of the way, and even though the wind's been moderately strong, the swells have stayed pretty small, a rare but very pleasant circumstance.

We've been seeing quite a lot of traffic over the past couple days. Given where we are, I guess it's not really surprising. Anybody coming from the south or west and going towards Taiwan, Japan, or even the U.S. west coast would be passing through this area. Still, I'm not used to seeing other ships every couple hours, and it's a little disconcerting. At least, it's enough to make me pay more attention than I might have in the middle of the Pacific. But in another day or two we should be far enough south along the Philippine coast that it will quiet down a bit.

Thanksgiving is in three days. Barring something dramatic, we'll still be at sea, which means we may be celebrating with a feast of canned chicken and corn. I can't say I'm too enthusiastic about the prospect; this is normally one of my favorite holidays, if for no other reason than it has some of the best food. I don't think I've ever missed having turkey on Thanksgiving before. Oh well, such is the price of having a schedule to keep: Singapore is still a ways from here and we only have a month to make it there. We'll just have to indulge in a delayed feast when we get to Palawan.

Nothing else much to say. This has been a nice, easy, quiet passage so far. After the adventures of the past few, quiet is more than welcome. Here's hoping it stays that way.

		<description><![CDATA[The gorgeous weather continues unabated. We're now back down around the same latitude as Guam, and the tropical weather hasn't disappointed. The winds have gotten lighter, which has slowed us a bit. We were becalmed again for most of yesterday afternoon and evening, and resorted to motoring for a while. But even with the drop in wind we're still making decent time overall, and the ride's immeasurably more pleasant than in 25 knot trades.

Today, in particular, is what I would call just about perfect sailing weather. We're beam reaching at about 5 knots off of an ESE 12 knot breeze. There are hardly and swells, and just a few scattered clouds to provide some occasional relief from the sun. It might be a little hotter than I'd ask for in an ideal world, but I prefer the heat to cold, and if it makes for warm nights it's a tradeoff I'm happy to live with.

While we were motoring last night, we got treated to quite an impressive light show. There was a huge bank of clouds on the eastern horizon that was flashing lightning every 10 seconds for most of the night. Most of them were inside or behind the clouds, but once in a while I caught glimpses of arcs, and once or twice a full sky-to-horizon bolt. Then around 7:30 or 8:00 the moon, still almost full, rose above the cloud tops, making the scene even more spectacular. For a few hours, I didn't even miss having internet access that much.

Waking up this morning and remembering that it was Thanksgiving, and that we have no Thanksgiving food, was extremely disheartening. Everything else is going great, and really in the scheme of things I've got nothing to complain about, but a Turkey dinner sounds really really good right now. I'm fervently hoping that we can find something close, or at least equally god, when we get to Palawan. I'm afraid it might be a long shot, but you never know.

The good news is that we're already within a couple hundred miles, so as long as this breeze holds out we'll be there this weekend. The brief research we did on our planned destination, Port Barton, was enough to make both ted and I pretty excited. The pictures looked like some travel agency's brochure for a secluded tropical paradise. The thought of arriving in paradise in two days is almost enough to take my mind off of turkey. Almost... but not quite.

		<description><![CDATA[We arrived at Port Barton on Sunday, and it turned out to be just as idyllic as we'd been hoping. In fact, maybe even a little more idyllic. The town is at the far end of a 10 mile long meandering bay, which gives it near-total shelter from the swells coming in off the South China Sea (which, as I've mentioned, are pretty small to begin with). Port Barton itself sits on a semi-circular cove about a mile across, every inch of which is soft sandy beach, with palm trees leaning out towards the sunlight in a manner so cliched that it's hard to take seriously.

Of course, there is no dock or anything, so once again we're anchoring. But the difference between here and Batan is night and day. This harbor is so well sheltered that we felt comfortable bringing Kallisti way in close to town, to where the water's only about 8 feet deep. With our 4.5 foot keel it doesn't give us much clearance, but the water is so calm that we feel pretty safe. And coming in that close makes it much less of a pain to shuttle to and from shore. In fact it's close enough to be swimmable, and I've been swimming out and back once a day just for the exercise.

As in Basco, the hotels are pretty cheap, so we're doing the same room-splitting deal here. For about $12 a night we get a shower (no hot water, but you don't really need it), a bed, power for recharging (camera, MP3 player, laptop, etc.) and Wi-Fi from 11 am to 3 pm and 6 pm to midnight. They also have a restaurant, and every meal I've had here has been excellent. Not quite excellent enough to erase my craving for a Thanksgiving feast, but damn good.

This little port town, consisting of a few thousand people, still doesn't have any immigration or customs office. For that we're going to have to catch a 4 or 5 hour Jeepney ride down to Puerto Princesa, Palawan's major city. We're planning to head there tomorrow, and since it's a half-day trip each way, we'll probably stay for a couple nights just to check it out. It will also be a good opportunity to hit an ATM and fill up on cash; Port Barton doesn't have any way for us to get pesos, and both of us are all but out of what we brought from Basco. (Luckily our hotel lets us put all our food and drinks on the room tab, or else we might have been back to canned tuna on the boat.)

Once we get back from Puerto Princesa, we're thinking we might spend next week getting scuba certified. There's a little dive shop here that offers a full course, complete with study books, theory sessions, and practice dives. I've been meaning to get into scuba diving for years now, and especially since we started spending so much time on remote tropical islands, but the right chance just hasn't come up yet. But we're planning to stick around here for at least another week, and there isn't all that much going on, so it seems like the perfect opportunity.

You might be wondering what this means for our schedule, and in particular what happened to the urgency to get to Singapore by Christmas. Well, the short answer is, we decided to take it a little slower and stop in Brunei instead of Singapore. It loses about 750 miles to do so, but frees up a lot more time to enjoy our stop here, which we just couldn't pass up. Brunei is only 5 or 6 days from here (assuming decent weather) so we can enjoy ourselves for another couple weeks before making the trip. It will only cost us a couple weeks' time when we start back up in January, and Ted says he'd rather spend the New Year's break in Brunei anyway.

The implications for longer-term planning are more nebulous. I had been holding out a slim hope that, if we made really great time across the Indian Ocean and up the Red Sea, we might be able to do the Atlantic crossing before hurricane season, and sail into Boston before July. If we'd left Singapore right at the start of January this goal was still a stretch, but possible. Adding in a couple weeks' delay pushes it that much further from being realistic, although it's still not quite out of the question.

Ongoing conversations with Ted have me leaning towards the following plan. Even by somewhat pessimistic estimates, with time to stop and enjoy things a bit, we should be able to make the Mediterranean by May or June of next year. At that point we'll put the boat up somewhere, until one of two things happens: either (a) we find a time window that fits both our schedules as well as the weather patterns to allow an Atlantic crossing, which in practice might mean late spring of 2012, or (b) we find a buyer who's willing to pay us enough that we're OK abandoning the last leg.

Of course our plans change every month, but I'm the sort of person who likes to at least have a sketch of a draft of a schedule in mind. This new plan sounds pretty good, even if it is just a rationalization for staying in this quiet paradise for an extra couple weeks. I mean, if that's not a good reason to change your plans, then what is?

There are 3 new sets: Batanes (which includes a couple shots from the passage from Okinawa), Batanes to Palawan, and Port Barton. The latter will hopefully get more added to it before we leave, but there are a couple shots that do a pretty good job of conveying the feel of this place.

Enjoy!

		<description><![CDATA[Normally I try to write a journal entry within the first day or two of each new passage, but I haven't been feeling very well since Monday, and it's been hard to work up the willpower to concentrate on it. Since I didn't write for most of the time we were in Palawan, a lot has happened, but I'll try to stick to the highlights. I'm feeling mostly better now, so writing isn't that onerous, but if I pen a lengthy essay my hand will get tired. (Can you believe people used to write whole books without word processors?)

When I first started feeling sick, I had some immediate semi-paranoid visions of it turning out to be malaria, or dengue (a.k.a. "breakbone") fever, or some other exotic tropical malady. Port Barton was a pretty remote spot in the middle of dense jungle, and it was impossible to avoid getting a few (or a few dozen) mosquito bites a day. After close observation of my symptoms though, plus some cursory Wikipedia reading, I'm pretty sure it was just plain old traveler's diarrhea. My usual early-passage discomforts probably compounded it a bit. And on Monday, when it was by far at its worst, my nasty hangover may not have been helping. Somehow it seems like a lot of our passages start with hangovers...

Aside from the suspect tap water though, the two weeks in Palawan were quite nice. I might put it up in my top three favorite stops of the trip, after Pohnpei and Chichijima. Even though the weather turned pretty rainy over the second half of our stay, it was so warm that it hardly bothered me. The rain was just a free shower, and with the seawater staying in the mid-80-degree range day and night, you could always take a quick swim to warm up. Throw in the peaceful surroundings, friendly people, and cheap food and drinks, and it makes life rather idyllic.

Our scuba course went well, also. The "dive shop" we went to was pretty much a one-woman show, owned and instructed by a gregarious German named Doris. Ted and I were the only students, so we got four days of effectively private classes, with plenty of time left over each day to relax on the beach near whatever reef we'd been diving on. Everything went smoothly, more or less; there was a learning curve to be sure but by the end we'd gone down as far as 18 meters, completed all the various skills, and passed the written exam. So now we're both officially licensed divers, and I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to get some more practice somewhere down the line.

As usual the toughest part was leaving. This time though, it was the immigration logistics. While we managed to convince the official in Puerto Princesa that it was OK for us to have flagrantly violated their policies simply because they were inconvenient, he still insisted we come back again to check out of the Philippines when we were leaving. Fortunately (for Ted, at least) they let me come by myself and bring both passports. But it meant making the five hour jeepney trip four times (two round trips) in ten days. The route is scenic enough, but given the cramped seating (I was shoulder-to-shoulder with a nursing mother for a couple hours) it gets old fast. Puerto Princesa itself is an Ok place, but definitely not worth that kind of travel. Oh well, it wasn't that bad in the end, and at least I found some good pizza in the city.

We had the first excitement of the passage just about immediately. Perhaps lulled into a false sense of security by apparently having gotten away with anchoring in six feet of water, we didn't think twice about leaving at just about low tide. After stowing the dinghy and taking up both our anchors, we headed out of the cover, but made it less than 100 feet before a hard jolt and a loud bang informed us that there were, in fact, some shallows nearby.

A common saying goes that there are three kinds of sailors: those who have run aground, those who will run aground, and damn liars. Personally I've always thought it's kind of a stupid joke, but you hear it so often that I'm kind of glad we finally got this one out of the way. Like the engine fire, it was bound to happen sooner or later. Fortunately we were still going pretty slowly, and were able to reverse away and turn back out to sea safely. Later, once we'd reached deeper water, we each took a turn swimming down to check the damage. I'm not an expert on fiberglass hulls, but I would call this "moderate" damage. There's clearly a chunk missing, but no signs of cracking or leaking, so probably no imminent danger. Still, we'll probably want to ry and fix it when we get a chance.

Since then the trip's been proceeding quietly, but slowly. Wind has been all but non-existent (until this afternoon anyway), and most of the pitifully short distance we've managed to cover has been under motor. We've spent a lot of time just becalmed and bored. Most of Wednesday afternoon was playing poker, and if you envision trying to play cards on the deck of a sailboat, that should tell you what the wind was like. We didn't lost any cards, either.

There have been a couple noteworthy events amidst the boredom of calm weather. One night, I forget whether it was Monday or Tuesday, I was on watch under a bright half moon. With calm seas and no wind I was lost in daydreams as usual when a bright, bright flash jarred me back to reality. My eyes shot up in time to see what was easily the brightest shooting star I've ever seen. It easily outshined the moon, and as my eyes caught up to the streaking head, I thought I glimpsed distinct blues and reds around the brilliant white center. The streak must have crossed a third of the sky, and I remember for a split second feeling a panic that it might impact and send a shockwave (probably just a Hollywood-induced fantasy, I realize, but you never know). Finally around 30 degrees above the Western horizon it seemed to break into a few separate embers and then disappear, like a firework fading into the night. I've seen a lot of shooting stars out here, but this was spectacular, and I doubt I'll forget it anytime soon.

The second event was yet another checkmark on the "Things Bound to Happen Sooner or Later" list. Around 2:00 this afternoon, we saw our first waterspout. It came about as unexpectedly as possible, on the heel of three days dead in the water. Drifting along at a knot or less, we looked back behind us to see a squall heading our way. It had all the usual hallmarks of a squall: A long line of tall, dark clouds with a mist extending down to the water's surface. What it also had, however, was a very clear and distinct funnel-shaped appendage, menacingly riding its front edge.

This was pretty surreal at first, since the squall was still a few miles off, and where we were there was barely a gentle breeze. Still, not wanting to take any chances, we dropped almost all our sails, expecting a ferocious blast when the front's leading edge hit us. Well before that happened though, the waterspout died off, and when the squall finally did hit we were surprised (and a bit disappointed) to find it was actually kind of weak. We had soon hoisted back up most of our sails, our concern for our safety giving way to a desire to make good use of our first wind in days. I still don't really understand how something so violent-looking could have been from such a mild squall (we've been through dozens at least that strong). But the important thing is, we got a few good pictures while it lasted.

The other important thing is that, against my expectations, a decent NE wind has stayed with us since the squall passed. We're actually sailing along at 4+ knots, more or less on course. I have a flight out of Brunei in six days, so I really can't afford to be waiting for wind all that much longer. A couple days of this weather, though, and we'll close the distance pretty easily.

So that's the news from Kallisti. Like I said, it's been an eventful couple weeks. Only a few more days' sailing left, and we can close the books on 2010. We'll see if those last few days turn up anything eventful of their own.

		<description><![CDATA[One of the things that's interesting about sailing is how different two passages can be from each other. As cold, scary, and exhilarating as our passage from Tokyo to Amami-oshima was just two months ago, this one has proved to be equally hot, boring, and frustrating. Where that passage rarely saw us doing less than 5 knots, even with our sails down, now we find we've scarcely had enough wind to justify raising them.

The wind that picked up Thursday afternoon lasted for almost a day, during which we made comparatively massive progress, but since then it's been back to becalmed. Several times I've been sure a fresh wind was picking up, and that we were a day away from reaching port, only to have the breeze fade again and disappear. This morning, with only about 90 miles to go to Brunei, I was sure we'd make it by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. But now, after covering on the order of 20 or 30 miles in 12 hours, it's looking doubtful (unless the wind picks up soon).

Of course, we could be motoring, but 60 or 70 miles is still a long way to do entirely under engine. We're really hoping it doesn't have to come to that. And it seems like such a short way to sail, if only even a faint breath of a wind would show up. It really doesn't seem like we're asking much. Plus, as infuriating as it will be if we don't get in tomorrow, arriving on Monday wouldn't be the end of the world. There's a certain sense of pride in making as much of the distance as possible without resorting to burning diesel.

There isn't really much else to say. Life during these calm days is extremely slow, and trying to describe it makes me want to take a nap. Instead, I'll just leave the entry at that, and get back to hoping for wind. I think I feel a little gust picking up...

		<description><![CDATA[It's probably obvious from the last SPOT update, but we made it into port, after a very slow and wind-free passage. Ted's preference was to stay on the Malaysian side of the bay rather than in Brunei itself, so Kallisti's resting at the Labuan public marina.

I took the ferry over to Brunei this morning, and I'll be flying to Tokyo tomorrow for a two week "vacation" (hey, ocean sailing is exhausting work). So that'll wrap up our 2010 travels. But we'll be right back out there in early January, heading for Singapore and the Indian Ocean crossing. Until then, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year's!

Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[The last couple days of the passage to Brunei were no better than the rest; if anything, it got a little bit worse. What little wind we did occasionally have was consistently out of the southwest, and we often found ourselves fighting a current of a knot or more. We covered just about all of the last 50 miles under engine.

All told the 420-ish nautical mile passage took us about seven full days, for a record-low average of 60 nm per day. Of that, we probably motored for over 30 hours/100 nm, so if you factor that out it was even slower. If I hadn't had a plane to catch, and we were feeling patient, we might have waited out the wind instead; I wonder how long it would have taken? Ten days? More? We'll never know I guess, but either way, I'm glad to have it behind us. I really, really hope the passage to Singapore comes with better winds.

Anyway, on Monday morning we made it into Labuan marina. For various reasons Ted decided he preferred this nearby Malaysian island to staying in Brunei itself, and it doesn't affect me much either way, so we settled in there. The facilities seemed pretty decent (much better than in our Philippine stops, at least) and there's supposedly some good diving. Part of me is actually jealous of Ted getting to stay there, but I have plenty to look forward to in Tokyo.

I took the 90 minute ferry over to Brunei yesterday morning, and spent the day wandering around the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. It has a few extremely beautiful buildings and plazas, including the spectacular Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque, but a few hours' walking is enough to cover the entire downtown area. I'm glad I got a chance to pass through and visit, but don't really regret only have a day here.

Tonight I'll be flying out of here en route to Tokyo. I'm looking forward to two weeks of recovering a little from the sailing lifestyle, which gets tiring after a while. For starters, I'm not sure that I've had more than a half dozen hot showers in total since we left Tokyo in October. But I'm also excited for the food, and most importantly for meeting up with friends. I find it consistently true that the hardest part of this trip, for me, is being away from so many people who are important to me. At least for the next couple weeks I'll get to see a few of them.

With all of our 2010 sailing behind us, this is probably my last journal entry of the year, so I figure I might as well take a moment to reflect on it all. It was almost exactly a year ago that we decided to take the detour up to Japan. At the time all I knew was that it would be an adventure, but it's turned out to be easily the weirdest (and most fun) year of my life. If I was looking for unpredictable and unexpected, I got it in spades. It has really been a year of jumping into the current (sometimes literally) and seeing where it takes me. So far, at least, it's a lifestyle I find extremely addictive, and I don't see any signs of giving it up in the near future.

That said, it's only natural to wonder what 2011 will bring. Our sketch of a plan is to leave here shortly after I get back in early January and head for Singapore. Then we'll go up the Straits of Malacca, stopping once or twice between there and the northern tip of Sumatra before beginning the Indian Ocean crossing. With luck and good wind, we'll make it to the Arabian peninsula by the end of March, before the monsoon starts to transition from NE to SW. Then the last major (expected) obstacle, the Red Sea, will be all that stands between us and springtime in the Mediterranean.

There are sure to be plenty of surprises along the way; it's just a question of what, when, where, and how much they affect the rest of our plans. But eventually, the trip will come to an end one way or another, and then it will be back to - what? I guess the time is fast approaching when I'll be thinking seriously about what to do with the rest of my life. There's no doubt in my mind that this experience has fundamentally reshaped my view of the world (geographically as well as metaphorically). Life is out there, more than you can possibly imagine, just waiting for you to come and find it. All you have to do is pick a direction and start sailing. What will my next direction be? Hopefully, I'll be finding out soon.

		<description><![CDATA[Two exciting things happened on the way down: 

First, we ran aground leaving Port Barton and rammed into some coral. Murky, uncharted waters... shit happens.  Anyway, I dove down on it when the waters cleared up and it looked kinda bad.  I don't have the expertise to judge it, but I'd say it looked similar to if you fell off a bike and scraped a knee hard enough to see bone.  You'll survive without medical attention, but probably want to get to a doctor or at least clean it up and patch it out. 

But it's not leaking or cracked, and we made it into Labuan without issue, so maybe it's fine.  The plan was to get the boat hauled out here, but the shipyard wants an outrageous 5000RM (~$1500) plus another 500/day to sit on the hard, so I think we're gonna have to wait on getting it repaired. 

(Note - for insurance purposes, this never happened, we ran aground shortly after buying the policy.) 

The second funny thing was seeing a waterspout leading the charge of an approaching squall.  Supposedly they're not usually dangerous, but it looked like a full-out tornado.  Luckily it dispersed before the front hit and it was just a squall like any other.  We'll get some photos of this up eventually.

		<description><![CDATA[Happy 2011! I'm back in Labuan now, and Ted and I are just about settled up here and ready to leave for Singapore tomorrow. We did our grocery shopping yesterday, loaded up on ice, and notified the marina that we'll be heading out. My mp3 players, camera, and kindle are all charged. Let the 2011 cruising season begin!

I had a great couple weeks in Tokyo, despite being sick most of the time. Apparently an overnight flight from the equator to mid-winter was more than my immune system could deal with, and I had a cold within hours of landing at Narita. But it never got much past the sniffles and coughing stage, and didn't interfere too much with having a wonderful time catching up with Naomi and my friends from Seattle. After months of not seeing them all, two weeks felt way too short, but hopefully it's enough to get us through this last stretch of separation before Ted and I make it to the Mediterranean.

Aside from the cold, I also had a relapse of the nasty stomach bug that hit me when we left the Philippines. It was bad enough that I brought myself to see a doctor here in Labuan when I got back, which is something I usually avoid (all they ever do is tell you that you're sick!). I've been reassured that it's nothing serious though, and given some medications that seem to have eliminated the more, shall we say, disruptive symptoms. I was also very impressed by the speed, quality, and price of my medical care experience: just 30 minutes and $8 was enough for the appointment, the examination, the diagnosis, and the medication. Given the current costs of US healthcare, it seems like a Malaysian vacation may be a good plan next time I'm sick. At any rate, it's a good excuse to come back to Malaysia.

While I was in Tokyo I picked up (via a friend from Seattle) the replacement power cable for our cockpit chart plotter, so hopefully later today I'll finally be able to repair and reinstall it. We've been living without it for so long now that it's almost hard to get the motivation to bother, but it really is nice to have when we can. Unfortunately, it seems like the new battery we got in Okinawa is pretty mediocre, and we've been running out of charge very quickly, so we may not be able to justify using the plotter much anyway. But at least when we're motoring (and therefore are running off the alternator) it'll be useful.

The wind forecast for this upcoming passage is mixed. Near the coast of Borneo it's pretty dead, just like it was when we were coming down. But it looks like if we can cut west for a hundred fifty miles or so, we can edge out into a bit more of a breeze. Working our way into the center of the South China Sea, there are some steady 15-20 knot winds to be found, and from there it should be great sailing down to the Singapore Strait. So the first few days could be pretty frustrating again, but hopefully overall the passage won't take more than 10 or 11 days.

On a totally unrelated note, there's a story from the last couple days of our last passage that I forget to record in this journal. I'm not normally too picky about keeping this all-inclusive, but I've already found myself telling this story three or four times, and feel like it's worth saving for posterity. If nothing else, it's one of the strangest (and yet somehow completely natural) experiences I've ever had.

It was mid-afternoon during one of the many periods where we were floating, totally becalmed, 15 or 20 miles offshore. Ted and I had both been down in the cabin for a bit (hiding from the sun), when I went outside to look around. Somewhat to my surprise, a man in a canoe about 50 meters off our stern waved at me as I came up. He was by himself, and the canoe was barely big enough to hold anyone else anyway. Unlike most of the boats we saw out that far offshore, it had no outriggers, and no shade structure or other structures of any kind. Just a plain canoe, about four meters long.

After waving, the man picked up a paddle and made his way over alongside us. Normally it'd be tough to keep two boats next to each other out on the open ocean like that, but with no wind, the sea was like a backyard pond. After some confused hand-signaling and broken English, he managed to convey to me that he wanted to know if we could give him some food. As it happened we had a huge supply of bananas that were starting to go bad, and were way more than we could eat anyway. So I went down inside, grabbed a bunch, and handed it down to him. He said thank you, fired up a tiny little engine he had hidden away inside the canoe, and puttered off. Three minutes later we were back to our quiet isolation in the middle of nowhere.

Part of why I wanted to write this story down is that a mere three weeks later I'm already not quite sure if it really happened, or was some crazy dream/hallucination concocted by my brain to break up the monotony of the day. I guess writing it down doesn't prove it was real, but it should at least help me remember the story. I hope he enjoyed the bananas...

Anyway, I think the afternoon heat may have let up enough to make working outside tolerable, so I'm going to go take a crack at rewiring the chart plotter. Presumably, it's just splicing a couple wires together and soldering them - how hard could that be?

		<description><![CDATA[We're pretty much all prepped to go, and plan to set sail for Singapore tomorrow morning. Our general plan is to head almost due west at first, and try to get out into better winds. Once we get close to Natuna Island, we'll cut southwest towards Singapore. Of course actual weather conditions (or spontaneous whim) may make us revise or completely abandon that plan, so we'll see. It's about 760 nm, so hopefully we can do it in 9 or 10 days, but if we get caught in winds like the last passage then who knows.

At any rate, wish us luck, and we'll be in touch from Singapore!

		<description><![CDATA[Much to our surprise, we've been having excellent winds so far this trip. When we pulled out of Labuan the water was glassy calm, and after a couple hours' motoring through the bay I was readying myself for another long and tedious passage. But as we pulled west of the last buoy marking the harbor's entrance a faint ripple on the sea ahead showed a breeze stirring. Within minutes it had picked up to a steady blow, and we were sailing along at 6 knots. Since then we haven't looked back, keeping up a 120 nm/day pace that could be a new record for us (if it holds out).

Unfortunately it's been a little rainy, and the direction of the wind has stayed consistently slightly forwards of a beam reach, making the ride a bit bumpy. The wind and rain have all but countered the otherwise unbearable heat, though, so altogether the conditions are about as good as we could ask for. At any rate, as long as we're doing 5+ knots on course pretty much anything is tolerable.

It's been quite obvious that we're in oil country. For the first couple nights the horizon was dotted in all directions with lights from oil/natural gas platforms, and only today, over 300 miles out from Brunei, have they finally petered out. Yesterday our course took us right by one, so we got a good close-up view. It wasn't much to look at, and we couldn't see anybody moving around, but a low hum of machinery seemed to indicate it was "running."

We also came within a few boat-lengths of a number of small fishing/commercial boats, which is pretty surprising to see this far offshore. It seems like the South China Sea just has a lot of boat traffic in general, and specifically lots of mid- and small-size vessels, particularly as compared to the Pacific. I'm curious to see what the Indian Ocean will be like.

I've been feeling a bit of a malaise the past few days, and finding it hard to concentrate on anything. Partially it's the rainy weather, but mostly I think I haven't quite fully readjusted to sailing life after my Tokyo trip. I got used to hot showers and a comfortable bed very quickly, and it's hard to let go. I've been spending a lot of time daydreaming about making it to the Mediterranean, and counting the days left 'til we get there. With at least three months left this probably isn't healthy, so I guess I should try to concentrate more on the here and now.

Singapore will hopefully be a good place to do just that. We'll probably be stuck there for at least a week while our hull is being repaired, and since we can't live on the boat during that time, there will be ample opportunity to explore the city. It's probably our last major city until the Red Sea, so I'll be taking the time to enjoy civilization: fast internet, international cuisine, lots to see and do. Then the real last leg begins, as we strike up the Strait of Malacca and head west past Sumatra. But for now, I'll postpone those thoughts, and just think about getting to Singapore. If the winds stay favorable, we could arrive this weekend!

		<description><![CDATA[In my never-ending search for useless geographic trivia about our progress, I discovered another milestone. Yesterday we crossed 109d E longitude, or exactly 180d away from Boston (which is at 71d W). This means that we are finally, at least as measured by longitude alone, headed towards our destination instead of away from it. So just hang on everybody, we'll be home any day now.

Another fun geographic note is that as close to the equator as we are (around 3d N last I checked) the North Star is no longer visible. Since Polaris' altitude above the horizon is equal to the observer's latitude (plus or minus a degree), it has sunk so low that it's lost in the haze. I actually find the difference between astronomy at the equator versus at higher latitudes to be quite interesting in general, but in case some people reading this don't share that opinion, I won't go into detail. Anyway, it's been so cloudy all week that we haven't seen any stars whatsoever, making the whole discussion rather academic.

The winds have stayed favorable though, despite the clouds, and we continue to make excellent time. It even looks like we might reach port in time to catch the Patriots' playoff game, a possibility I hardly even considered when we were leaving Labuan. Never mind that due to time zone awkwardness the game's on at 5:30 Monday morning; I'm sure we could find somewhere to watch it. We still have about 180 nm to go, so getting in on Sunday is far from a certainty, but if the forecast holds and these winds stay with us then our chances should be good.

We've started our list of things to try to get repaired in Singapore. It will most likely be our last access to quality parts and facilities until the far side of the Indian Ocean, so we're hoping to take care of as much as we can. There are a number of minor-to-moderate issues that have accumulated over the past few months, or are leftover from last year: a crack in the main gooseneck, a broken mid-ship cleat (from all the way back in Rota), replacing one or both batteries, and installing the new chart plotter cables. But the primary issue is definitely the hull, and the damage to the keel from our mishap leaving Port Barton.

In case there's doubt as to whether we're concerned about the hull, let me relate a story from a few nights ago. I was cat-napping in the cockpit during my watch shift, as I often do. Suddenly I woke with a start, and looking around, had a very compelling sensation that the water appeared higher up relative to the sides of the boat than usual. Convinced that something in the hull had finally given way, I anxiously climbed down into the cabin, expecting to find it a foot deep in rising water, Ted somehow still asleep and unaware. Of course there was no such flooding, nor even an unusual amount in the bilge, and after a minute I had woken up enough to realize the whole thing was a half-dreaming unfounded panic. Still, it illustrates pretty clearly that my subconscious takes the integrity of the hull seriously.

The more we do this sailing thing, the more I genuinely believe that it's actually pretty safe. As long as the boat's floating and we have fresh water, everything's fine. But things that endanger the boat's ability to float, such as damage to the hull, are worth being overly cautious about. I'm relatively confident that the chip on our keel isn't a big deal, but if we're going to be crossing the Indian Ocean (consisting of a couple 1000+ nm passages) then a professional reassurance would really make my catnaps more peaceful.

On a totally unrelated note, yesterday may have marked a new low water mark in our culinary history. I'm ashamed (but also a little proud) to say that we had franks and beans for breakfast... and then again for dinner. But in our defense we were running out of ice, so they needed to be eaten soon. Plus the hot dogs were actually pretty good, and we haven't found decent hot dogs for a surprisingly large number of stops. It may not sound like much, but when you find a meal that hits the spot out here, it's hard to go back to canned tuna. Ted's first words after waking up for his shift this morning were, "I could really go for some franks and beans."

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like we'll be in Singapore through the end of January. We got hauled out on Tuesday, and after they'd scraped and pressure-washed the hull, we handed them a long list of potential work-items to get quotes on. As I mentioned before, this will probably be our last access to good repair facilities for a while, so we want to get done as much as we can. They got back to us Wednesday with estimates for everything, and we've decided to go ahead with most of them. The long pole (in terms of time) is the anti-fouling and paint on the hull, which will take a week or 10 days depending on weather, so we're expecting to get back in the water around the 1st of February.

The damage to the keel from running aground in Port Barton turned out to be pretty minimal after all, and they had it patched up within an afternoon. Other than that we're having them replace our cracked gooseneck and house battery, and possibly do some engine servicing (depending on whether the necessary filters can be delivered in time). It's probably going to come out to around SG$6,000.

The extra time in port, as well as the large price tag, are difficult to swallow. But in the long run it seems like the right choice, given that we'll probably have to do most of this stuff sooner or later anyway, and in some cases not doing it risks a more serious and/or dangerous problem. And besides, we knew at the outset that maintenance on an old boat, and over such long distances, would add up to a hefty sum before the trip was over. We've been keeping it to about 20% of the purchase price per year, which seems in line with what I'd expect.

Besides the issues I mentioned, there's one more that has been a particular source of annoyance and frustration: the chart plotter. The day before we arrived in Singapore I took a stab and rewiring it with the new cables. We knew the Singapore Strait would be busy and thought having charts available from the cockpit would be helpful. A little to my surprise I actually got the wiring right, and got the chart plotter working again. Unfortunately though, it lasted for less than a couple hours before it started having problems again. Specifically, the power button was acting like it was being pressed constantly, with the effect of turning the unit on and off without us touching it. Eventually, it just turned off altogether, and we couldn't get it back on.

Now, we had sent this unit in to Raymarine over the summer to have them repair an almost identical problem. Last spring we'd been gradually losing the ability to press a bunch of the various function buttons, similar to what happened with the power button here. So they charged us $400 to repair it, but apparently, they didn't really fix the problem. We're also pretty sure this isn't a new issue, because the unit was sitting in storage almost the entire intervening time while we tried get the replacement cables from the states.

As it happens, the repair shop we're using for all our other work is also an authorized Raymarine service center. They took a look and said there's corrosion on the circuit board, and we'll have to replace it, which costs another $300. Naturally, we're pretty frustrated with the whole thing at this point, and ready to give up on it unless Raymarine's willing to foot the bill (seeing as we already paid them to fix exactly this problem). I sent them a request; we'll see what they say.

Anyway, all this repair work leaves us with some time to kill in Singapore. Raffles marina, where we're staying, is quite a nice facility, so fortunately the wait should be pleasant. There's free Wi-Fi, a pool, a good restaurant, and even a bowling alley (which I haven't made use of yet). Plus they have a free shuttle that connects to the closest few train stations, making access in to the city relatively pain-free.

I spent most of yesterday exploring the sights around the downtown area, and was impressed with what I saw. There are a lot of beautiful buildings and park areas, not to mention a kind of ridiculous number of malls, all of which are enormous. Perhaps the most notable attraction is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, and enormous three-towered structure with a platform across the top. Aside from being a very distinctive form in the city's skyline, it's also noteworthy for the pool that's on the roof, which runs right up to the edge and makes a pretty spectacular viewing point. Unfortunately, the pool's only open to hotel guests (and rooms start at over $300/night), but there's an observation area open to the public.

Next week, aside from continuing my explorations of the city, I also plan to try and visit the US Embassy. This will be our last access to an embassy before we cross the Indian Ocean, and I'm hoping the department of state might have some resources or information regarding the pirate situation in the Gulf of Aden. I happened to strike up a conversation with a crew member of a boat that just passed through there a few months ago, doing the opposite voyage (from the Mediterranean to Singapore), and said the situation there is pretty serious. She said she thinks we should still go ahead and do it, and pointed me at some good resources, but said it's definitely worth doing your homework.

As usual for our stays on land, Ted and I have been spending most of our time separate, so I don't really know how he's passing the time. But we do share access to the laptop, and more than a few times I've found him just playing chess, either against the computer or online. I think I've discovered that where I've been spending my free time picking up Japanese (I can read over 400 kanji now!) Ted's attempting to become a chess Grand Master. We've been playing more on the boat lately too, and all the practice against him has improved my game as well. The day we got into Singapore I actually won a game for the first time - but only after he let me take back a few pivotal mistakes I made. Given that he seems to be playing for hours a day though, I don't know if I'll be able to keep up.

Sometime before we leave we'll have to do a bunch of provisioning, and make use of this temporary access to big supermarkets to stock up. And we also need to figure out where we'll be stopping in the Strait of Malacca, and generally sort out our route for the next few weeks. We've got some time before we have to deal with all that though, so it's back to kanji, chess, and relaxation for a while.

		<description><![CDATA[Our repairs finished faster than expected, so we're taking advantage of it to get a jump start on the trip up the Strait of Malacca. We'll be heading out all but momentarily, and our planned destination is Phuket, Thailand. Once we clear immigration there we're hoping to get to some smaller islands nearby. The passage is a little over 500 nm, but with a forecast for light winds (typical for the Strait) it might take a week or so. 

I posted some pictures from our last passage and from here in Singapore, including good details of the damage/repairs to the hull:

		<description><![CDATA[Well Thailand's official time zone is UT+07:00, so today we moved our clocks back an hour. Thus ends two months' time in UT+08:00; it's always gratifying to cross time zones, as it's concrete evidence of our westward progress. In fact I'm kind of looking forward to the Indian Ocean crossing, for that very reason. Thailand to the Maldives alone is 25d of longitude - and we only did 30d of longitude in all of 2010 combined! But such is the price of major north-south detours. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.

The stop in Singapore went pretty well. The boatyard which performed the various repairs was a little on the pricey side, but the quality and service were excellent. The quotes were honest and accurate, and they finished almost a week ahead of what they promised. It feels really good to have a nice patched-up hull with fresh paint, plus the other little things they took care of. We're ready for an ocean crossing now.

I also developed quite a favorable impression of the country during our 11 day stay. It felt modern, vibrant, extremely diverse, and altogether a pleasant place to live. Being on the equator it has nice temperate weather year round, and is subject to essentially zero natural disasters. As a visitor (and on a cheap budget), my primary complaints were (a) things are expensive and (b) shopping seems to be the national pastime. That said I have to admit that I'd definitely consider moving there for a year or two someday, if the opportunity ever arose.

The boat went back into the water on Wednesday, and by Thursday afternoon we were checked out with immigration and ready to go. The last 24 hours included a bunch of rushed logistics: a last-minute propane delivery, e-mails to Raymarine about the warrant on our chartplotter, and finally signing up for an insurance policy (or as I can't help but think of it, "betting some guy that our boat will be destroyed"). Since leaving on Friday is strictly out of the question, though, we were anxious to get out or risk losing two days.

We were expecting light winds once we got into the Strait of Malacca, but to our pleasant surprise we've actually made great time so far. We were becalmed for a few hours overnight but otherwise have been mostly over 6 knots, and occasionally even into the mid-7's. We hardly ever get up that high, so either the new paint on the hull made a huge difference, or we're being helped along by a current. Probably a little of both. Either way the net effect was that we covered about 130 miles in the first 24 hours of the passage, which is a good start compared to our estimate of 70/day. As of this writing the breeze has slacked off a bit, but hopefully enough sticks around to keep us moving. If we can just clear another 150 miles or so we should get up into the NE monsoon that blows over the Indian Ocean, and from there it'll be a piece of cake.

The one facet of this passage that's proved interesting so far is the shipping traffic. The strait is only 20 or 30 miles wide in this southern stretch, and all the traffic passing through Singapore gets funneled into the same mile-wide northbound and southbound shipping lanes. Consequently we've had a steady stream of boats passing us in both directions since the moment we got clear of the anchorage. It's not nearly as crazy as in the Singapore Strait itself, but still enough to keep you on your toes.

I've talked a lot recently about crowded shipping lanes and whatnot, but I feel like it might be hard to visualize for someone who hasn't been out on the open ocean (i.e. most people). So I came up with an analogy hat might help put it in perspective... or it might just be confusing, I don't know. Here goes.

Imagine a huge, empty parking lot, about two miles by two miles, with no light posts or dividers or signs - just flat, empty pavement. Now periodically a school bus will pass through, at a parking-lot-safe 5 miles per hour. It takes a while to get across such a big space at that speed, but they have plenty of time and go in a straight line. These represent big container ships, which make up most of the traffic. There are also a few smaller vehicles - box trucks, vans, the occasional car. These are smaller shipping vessels, fishing boats, coast guard, etc. And our little sailboat is an old man with a walker, who takes a couple hours to cross the whole lot.

This gives you a decent approximation of a 1:5 scale model of the open ocean. So when I say it's busy here, that means a couple school buses go by (at 5 mph) every 10 or 20 minutes. We move so slowly, and are so small compared to them, that they can easily avoid us - as long as they see us. The part that makes it slightly harrowing is that if they don't see us, we can't do much to get out of their way. That's why night time is much more dangerous than daylight (remember, they don't have headlights). Still, I hope the analogy illustrates the point that there's a ton of space relative to how fast everyone's moving, so with a modicum of caution it's pretty safe.

Thailand should be a lot of fun. We've met quite a few people who recommended it, and all the pictures I've seen of Phuket and the nearby islands look gorgeous. I'm really hoping to get a chance to do some diving, and practice what we learned in the Philippines before I forget it all. Less than 400 nm to go, we'll see if the wind continues to cooperate.

		<description><![CDATA[Predictably, immediately after I finished by last journal entry the wind died. Following that were two annoying days of mostly calm, with enough occasional hints of a breeze to keep us constantly raising and lowering sails. Due to the narrow channel and varying conditions we must have crossed through shipping lanes a half dozen times, and it seemed like the wind always chose the moment we were mid-channel with a tanker bearing down on us to die off. And naturally this was accompanied by little rain squalls every few hours, culminating in a steady drizzle all of yesterday evening.

To be fair, that's pretty much what the weather forecasts had predicted. Just to be sure I fired up our SailMail (which we've barely used since Tokyo) and got a fresh wind forecast, but it confirmed the pattern I'd been seeing when I was checking in Singapore: decent wind on the first third of the passage, and great on the last third, but nothing in between. Once I had resigned myself to that fact it wasn't so bad, and it motivated me to do some motoring to get those middle 200 miles over with.

As of now we only have another 40 miles or so to go before we get into the steady ENE monsoon winds (assuming the forecast is accurate). What's mre, we actually have a bit of a breeze that seems to be holding. It's out of the southeast, which is forcing us to go a little more north than our desired heading of 335d, but at a 5 knot clip we should be into good winds by nightfall. Once we're there we'll shoot straight to Phuket like a cork from a champagne bottle (I hope). Plus the sun's out for the first time in days, and to top it off we had bacon for breakfast. So things are looking pretty good.

We hit a pretty major milestone yesterday, which is that for the first time we broke out our electronic charts for the Mediterranean. We've still got a long way to go, but it's starting to feel close enough that we can think about our plans. We had a very preliminary discussion about where we might go; it's a highly complex topic due to the number of outstanding unknowns (timing, budget, etc.) and to the number of very attractive options. That said we reached a tentative consensus that cruising in the Aegean for a month or so sounds pretty awesome, so I think for now that's the frontrunner. I guess we'll keep it as a background brainstorming/research topic for another month and see how we feel. But if anyone reading this is hoping to meet us in the Med, consider this your early early notice: Aegean in late May, maybe.

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, I posted pictures from our passage from Singapore, as well as from the time we spent over on Koh Phi Phi: 

http://www.flickr.com/photos/55615515@N02/sets/72157626002439846/

Second, since a lot of people ask about pirates, and we're coming up on that part of the trip, I thought I'd share the information we're working with. The ISAF has a guide for yachts sailing through the Gulf of Aden area, which is the most comprehensive and up-to-date source I've seen so far: 

http://www.sailing.org/33542.php 

If you're curious what the situation is really like, and what we'll be dealing with, feel free to take a look. The summary as I see it is that there is a risk but a relatively small one. Very very few of their targets have been small yachts like ours, so the biggest danger is that one of their boats stumbles onto us and is bored or desperate. And if the worst happens and we get taken hostage, based on past incidents it'd probably attract international attention. So we'll either be safe or famous. 

Cheers, 
Kevin

		<description><![CDATA[After a week in Thailand, my feelings are mixed. The landscapes are breathtaking, the beaches are perfect, the weather is lovely, and the food is excellent (especially if, like me, you love curry). The downside is that, at least in the two places we've stopped, it's jam-packed with tourists. Supposedly you can get out to some quieter spots, and if that's true (and you can find them before everyone else does), it would be a hell of a place to spend a few weeks, or months, or years. As things stand, I'm already kind of ready to leave.

After my last journal entry we eventually did make it into the monsoon winds, albeit 30 or 40 miles further north than I'd expected. We made good time, aided along the way by an unexpected but powerful northerly current. During our motoring we got up close to 9 knots a couple times, which means the current must have been at least 2 knots, maybe closer to 3. It's weird that we didn't hear or read anything about a current that strong, and we're quite glad it wasn't going in the other direction. Anyway, with the help of the current and good winds, we flew through the last 150 miles or so to round out what was one of our easier and more pleasant passages.

We got to Phuket at night and didn't want to try and deal with navigating a crowded and unfamiliar harbor in the dark, so we dropped anchor offshore of an island on the far side of the bay. At sunrise we motored over to the pier and I kept watch while Ted took the dinghy ashore to clear immigration. Luckily the process went quickly and within less than two hours he made it back to the boat. At that point we had to decide where to go; we knew we wanted to try and visit Koh Phi Phi, which lay about 25 nm to the east, against the prevailing monsoon winds. We also wanted to spend some time at Pa Tong, which is on the east side of Phuket. We decided it made sense to beat into the wind first, and come back downwind once we'd had our fill of Koh Phi Phi. So we motored east all that afternoon, and got into Loh Dalum harbor around 5 pm.

Koh Phi Phi Don, the main island in the group, consists of two main landmasses running north-south, which are connected by a little spit of low-lying beach across the middle. This stretch of land, barely 500 meters wide, houses just about all the development on the island. It's a small area, but since the 2004 tsunami (which apparently wiped out just about everything) it's been redeveloped into a jam-packed neighborhood of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, bars, dive shops, massage parlors, and even a couple 7-11's. It seems that we got there during the high season, and the place was packed to the brim.

As I've written about before, staying on the boat while it's anchored has some inherent drawbacks. The biggest one is that Ted and I have to coordinate our trips to and from shore, because we only have one dinghy. In Koh Phi Phi, there was an added complication: the tide. At high tide the water comes right up to the edge of the beach bars, but when it goes out, it goes way out - probably over 200 meters. When we first got in the tide was low, and we didn't realize quite how far it was going to come back up, so we left our dinghy tied to another boat's anchor line a little ways up from the waterline. That night Ted ended up swimming out, looking around for 10 minutes, and then having to dive down underwater to untie the boat.

Having learned our lesson, we realized that we should try to plan our trips to and from shore to be at high tide. With the moon just shy of new, this put high tides around 11 am and 11 pm, so fortunately it wasn't too terrible to adapt our schedule to this. Still, it's pretty inconvenient, and once it was clear that there were zero vacancies in any hotel on the island (under $100) we resolved to get out of there ASAP. Our desire to move on was strong enough that we set out for Phuket on Friday night, technically breaking our "never leave on a Friday" rule. We rationalized it by saying that it wasn't really a passage, more or a day trip, in fact just changing anchorages really. That didn't stop the trip over from seeing the apparent death of our 2nd chart plotter though, forcing us to fall back on the little handheld GPS we keep as an emergency spare.

We made it to Phuket Saturday morning, and the housing situation here isn't quite so dire. Both of us managed to find rooms in town, which has made the stay a lot more pleasant. On Sunday and Monday I took my PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course, which included my first wreck dive and a maximum depth of 23 meters. In theory I'm certified to go all the way down to 30 now, but who knows when I'll get my next chance to dive.

Without much keeping us here we had been planning to spend Tuesday supplying up and then get under way for the Maldives by this morning. We had given up on the repairs for our primary chart plotter, since the Raymarine service agent here said it would take three weeks to get the parts. But Monday night we got another e-mail from him informing us that the parts could be expedited and arrive in only five days, which seemed worth the delay, especially given the failure of our backup chart plotter. So it looks like we'll be here through the weekend.

In the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that I've been fighting with a cold for the last two days, which may be negatively influencing my opinion of this place. I know it's always easy to let your mood sour your view of any destination (person, movie, book...) that you go to (meet, see, read...). I have to think it's more than just that though. I think that I've really developed a taste for quieter places, where everyone's friendly just to be friendly, not to get you to buy something. Looking back on my favorite stops of our voyage (Pohnpei, Rota, Chichijima, Port Barton) they've all been little towns mostly invisible on tourist maps. Maybe it's that what I value most in travel is meeting the locals, and in places that are packed with tourists it's just really hard to do that.

Anyway, looking ahead to our next leg, I've started researching the Maldives a bit. Prior to this we'd always sort of assumed we'd be going to Male, the capital and main population center of the country. It turns out that there are a couple other options though. One that's caught my eye is Uligamu, a little speck of an island at the northern tip of the Maldives chain. It's only got a few hundred inhabitants, and as far as I can tell little development and no tourism to speak of. The only reason it has immigration facilities is because it's become somewhat of a popular stopping point for yachts passing through towards the Red Sea, e.g. us. It won't have anywhere near the supplies or facilities of Male, but it seems like a way more interesting place to go. Plus it's a slightly more direct route, which saves 50 or 100 nm of total distance.

After the Maldives comes the fun one: the trip through the Gulf of Aden and the domain of the infamous Somali pirates. (What round-the-world sailing adventure would be complete without pirates?) We've contacted the relevant military agencies to inform them of our transit plans, and we've read all the various recommendations we could find. At this point I feel like we're as prepared as we can be, so all that's left is to just go through and see what happens. In all honesty I'm a lot less worried about it than I was about typhoons coming down from Tokyo, but there's no question that it's a risk. On the other hand commuting on the freeway is a risk, and I'm pretty sure arriving in Djibouti will be a lot more satisfying than making it safely to work.

		<description><![CDATA[I know I won't get much sympathy on this one, but we're still stuck waiting for the replacement parts for our chart plotter, which has forced us to lie on the beach in Phuket doing nothing for a week and counting. It actually is getting pretty frustrating, since we have no idea when the parts will arrive, and the clock on the favorable weather for the Indian Ocean crossing is ticking. I'm really, really hoping they get in tomorrow, and we can be under sail by sunset. That failing, I really really hope they get in Wednesday. And so on. 

Anyway, you'll know we finally left when SPOT goes out.

		<description><![CDATA[Here we are, more than two weeks after our arrival, still in Thailand. When we started out from Labuan at the beginning of 2011 my expectation was a slow passage to Singapore, a long delay there for lengthy repair work, another long trip up the Strait of Malacca, and just a quick few days' sightseeing in Thailand (or Malaysia - we hadn't decided yet) before the Indian Ocean crossing. When we had good wind in the South China Sea, and made Singapore in only a week, I thought we'd gotten pretty lucky. Then the repairs were done more than a week early, and we were on our way by January 27th, which I hadn't even dreamed to be possible. The 3 knot current up the Strait, which was apparently a spontaneous gift from the gods, got us into Thailand on February 1st, and I could hardly believe how well things were going. We could relax for a full week and still be under way by the 8th, putting us in great shape to be in the Red Sea by April 1st or earlier.

The fact that we're now eight days behind that mark, and counting, is due to a phenomenon which I first heard described in terms of the Elevator Dilemma. It probably has lots of other names/forms. The basic premise is as follows: you are on (let's say) the 2nd floor of a building, and you want to go up to (let's say) the 7th floor. You know that it will take about 60 seconds if you go by the stairs. On the other hand, the elevator only takes 15 seconds, plus however long you have to wait after pushing the button.

Now, you don't have any statistics handy on the average waiting time for this particular elevator, but as a regular elevator-rider you can make some educated guesses. You estimate an average wait of say 15 seconds. Sometimes you'll be unlucky and it might be 30, but even then you're still better off with the elevator. And you might even get it in 5, arriving at floor 7 a full three times faster than the workout route. This burst of mental arithmetic completed, you confidently push the "up" button and start humming something by Queen while you wait.

Five seconds go by, and no elevator. Oh well, that was a pipe dream anyway. Another ten go by. Then ten more. You glance down at your watch impatiently, thinking that if you'd taken the stairs you'd already be rounding the landing on the 4th floor. But it's not until 40 seconds have passed that you begin to feel like the elevator was a mistake. You can't believe it hasn't come yet - this is way off the chart of normal elevator wait times.

This is where the core of the Elevator Dilemma hits home. You are now in a situation where, if you'd known the elevator would take this long, you would obviously have just taken the stairs. However, all intuition you have about elevators tells you that it should be there any second. And if you start on the stairs now, it's still a full minute to the 7th floor. But, other beleaguered logic circuits cut in, waiting for this damn elevator's already cost us over a minute! Maybe something's wrong? At this point you grimly realize that, in accordance with Murphy's Law, you are guaranteed to come out of this the substantial loser. If you wait for the elevator it will never come (probably broke down again); if you take the stairs the elevator will arrive the instant you're out of earshot.

Yesterday we finally got a hold of the tracking number for our chart plotter's replacement parts, which shed some light on the situation. It turns out the package arrived in Bangkok last Thursday morning (the 10th) and has been waiting there under a "Clearance delay" (the DHL tracking site's wording) ever since. The Raymarine dealer informed us that this was because of "something to do with the wrong number has been given for the description of goods." This is sort of like somebody walking past as you irritably tap the "up" button and casually mentioning that his buddy's moving furniture up on the 8th floor, but don't worry, they're almost finished. Now you know why it's taking so long, but the Dilemma is little abated.

I'm not really aware of any "solution" to the Elevator Dilemma. Obviously, we've chosen in this case to just keep waiting. The analogy's imperfect though, because in our case "taking the stairs" means leaving our broken chart plotter behind. We could potentially get it shipped ahead to us somewhere in the vicinity of Africa, but that sounds like all kinds of hassle. And it must be noted that the elevator lobby turns out to be a beautiful tropical beach.

One way of coping with the wait is to commiserate with the other poor bastards who, like you, were too lazy to take the stairs. Misery loves company. In my case that translates into this journal entry, which probably comes off as a tedious whiny rant. But hey, it helps pass the time. And as luck would have it, while I was writing this little dissertation I got a notification e-mail from DHL, informing me that said package has (finally) cleared Thai customs. (I know, you think I made that up for dramatic effect - I guess I'm the only one who'll know for sure.)

Anyway, that e-mail far from guarantees that we'll be leaving tomorrow. There are many miles between Bangkok and Phuket, and then the parts have to actually be installed: plenty of opportunity for further delays. But at least the elevator has moved off the 8th floor, and the "stop hogging the elevator" buzzer (which you can hear from six floors down, if you put your ear to the doors) has turned off. There is light at the end of the tunnel!

Here's to hoping that my next entry is from the Andaman Sea.

		<description><![CDATA[The parts arrived in Phuket on Thursday morning, so after a week of stalling Ted and I mobilized for our departure preparations: buying provisions, clearing immigration, and of course retrieving the repaired chart plotter. The latter two required transportation, so while I did the shopping Ted rented a scooter and drove all over Phuket. If you've ever been there you'll appreciate how heroic of an act this is; it was probably more dangerous than the entire Indian Ocean crossing.

When he got to the repair shop, he found out that the package hadn't actually been delivered, but the store had gone and picked it up. I guess our twice-a-day phone calls had successfully conveyed a sense of urgency to them. It's a good thing too, because apparently Friday was a holiday and we'd have been stuck waiting 'til Monday. But in the end it all worked out, and with one final load of ice and snacks we rode the dinghy out to Kallisti as the sun was setting.

It took some time to put things away, haul up the dinghy, and take in 300' of anchor chain. (I don't think I mentioned it, but early in our stay at Patong our boat seemed to get moved to a totally different location, with about twice as much chain let out, and without our knowledge or consent. We decided to just let this mystery slide.) By the time we pulled out of the harbor it was 8:00 pm, and it was only then that we got around to actually reinstalling the chart plotter.

Keep in mind, it has been literally a full year (or more) since we had a fully functional cockpit chart plotter. I had all but forgotten what it's like. Plus, during the delays waiting for parts, I was so frustrated by the wait that I hardly considered the end result: namely, having a fully functional cockpit chart plotter again. So when we finally got the thing turned on again it came as a sudden realization.

I don't want to make too big of a deal out of it. We lived without the thing for several thousand nautical miles, and did just fine. But it is really convenient, when it's working. For all the frustration I had with Raymarine over the course of this process, in the end they got our unit fixed, at no cost to us, and with a relatively modest delay (which may well have been due to Thai customs). I could now at least consider recommending them to any prospective world sailors out there. We'll see how long these repairs last.

As for the passage, it started out very slow. Thursday night and most of Friday we barely had enough wind to fill the jib, and ended up drifting west at a couple knots. This isn't too surprising given the forecasts I'd been watching, which showed lighter winds than what I understood to be the norm for this season. Nevertheless I've been glad to have a breeze pick up this morning, gradually pushing us into the 4-5 knot range. The whole time it's been out of the northeast quadrant, making for lovely downwind cruising. There's still no swell to speak of, nor any sign of rain or squalls. If the weather stays this way the rest of the passage then it'll be a longish trip, but at least we'll be comfortable.

Just to mix things up Ted and I swapped shifts for this leg, giving me the midnight-to-sunrise portion of the night watch. My body's still adjusting but we've got nothing but time. Plus we're back to real open ocean sailing, of the "no land and 1-2 distant ships per day" variety, which makes cockpit naps very easy. So for now life is good. In another four or five days, when we're out of ice and fresh food, and have more than halfway still to go, we'll see how I feel.

		<description><![CDATA[The weather has continued pretty much as reported, and this morning our 4 knot westward plod brought us past the south tip of Great Nicobar Island. We are now officially in the Indian Ocean, and there are 800 miles of open water ahead of us before we get to Sri Lanka. We weren't originally planning to stop there, but after a few days of cruising boredom, plus a review of just how much of a detour it is (hardly any, it turns out), we're considering it. There's still plenty of incentive to move quickly, so if we do stop I imagine it'll be just long enough to fill up on ice, water, and fresh food. We'll see.

We talked a little bit more about plans for the summer (and beyond) last night. As complex as the options are for where to go in the Med, the options for what comes after that are even more confusing. If we decide not to sell the boat, then we have to figure out where to leave it for the winter, which could theoretically be anywhere from the Aegean to the Azores, or maybe even Bermuda. If we decide to sell the boat, the question of where to sell it still looms large. And the intermediate option of planning not to sell it unless we get a good offer, our de facto plan of record, just makes these questions blurrier. Besides which any of these plans could be further complicated if one or both of us get a job in the meantime. After a good hour of chasing this all in circles, we pretty much concluded that we can't decide anything until we get to the med, or at least the Red Sea. At least then our hypothetical sketches of timelines for the next 4000 miles will have resolved into concrete dates, and questions like "Can we make it to Bermuda before July?" can be answered with a little credibility.

Trying to work through all of these scenarios got me thinking about my personal plans for the future, and I am slowly beginning to suspect something: coming back to Reality may turn out to be the hardest part of this whole trip. After more than two years of traveling, I'm coming back to more or less a blank slate. I have some general ideas and outlines of the life I want to build, generated bit by bit over countless hours of staring at water and sky. The thought that a few months from now I'm going to have to actually lay some metaphorical bricks is both exciting and more than a little intimidating.

If I needed any more evidence that I've adapted to the cruising lifestyle, this passage has proved it. So far it's been uneventful to the point of parody. The weather is constant enough that we are practically just passengers, and the occasional tweaks to sails are second-nature by now, not even interrupting my train of thought. The highlight of the past three days was yesterday's afternoon chess game, in which I earned my first-ever draw against Ted, no take-backs or undos. Occasionally I remind myself that two years ago this would have been crazy and exciting. But most of the time it's just another day of life.

This blase attitude is probably a sign that I should be moving on to something else pretty soon. It seems to be my blessing and my curse that nothing holds my attention for more than a couple years. On the other hand, maybe this is all just a rationalization for wanting to resume regular access to showers, TV, and pizza. Either way, our trip's approaching the closing stages anyway, so moving on is inevitable. I suppose now that I'm adjusted to life at sea, I should make the best of what's left of it before my wanderlust reduces it to a journal and a memory.

		<description><![CDATA[The wind is still great, and we've been doing upwards of 130 nm/day for several days now. We crossed another time zone and are poised, if the wind holds, to arrive at Galle, Sri Lanka around Sunday. Our book on world cruising routes (coincidentally named "World Cruising Routes") says that if done in the right season, Thailand to Sri Lanka can be one of the most pleasant passages. Two thirds in, I'd be willing to agree.

As we get further and further west, the passage through Somali pirate territory is beginning to loom large. We've been forced to think about it even more, ever since we found out (via satellite phone) that there was another pirate attack on a yacht, as a result of which all four of her American crew were killed. We don't have access to all the details, but it sounds like she was on a very similar route to what we had planned. It was a bigger boat than us, so perhaps easier to spot (by sight or radar), but the similarity is close enough to give one pause. The incident was tragic, and as a fellow sailor my heart goes out to the victims and their loved ones. Now, I have to think hard about our plans going forward.

Ted and I have naturally had a few discussions, and probably have several more to come. First, we talked about alternatives to going through the Gulf of Aden. We could try to sell the boat somewhere around here. We could leave it somewhere and go home for a while, planning to resume if and when the piracy situation gets under control, but who knows how long that might be. We actually discussed the possibility of detouring around the Cap of Good Hope, and got as far as checking maps and time tables. Ultimately though, all of these scenarios are pretty unappealing, for one reason or another.

We spent some time thinking about ways we could reduce the risk of getting caught by pirates, assuming we continue as planned. One relatively easy option is to detour a little further to the northeast, giving ourselves an extra 100 or 200 miles' distance from the Somali coast. Due to the huge range of space that has been covered by past attacks, though, it's tough to say how much protection this would really add. Still, it probably couldn't hurt.

Aside from avoiding pirates altogether, there are strategies to try and avoid getting taken hostage, which is the primary danger. (They could steal everything on our boat and, in the grand scheme of things, it would amount to a minor inconvenience.) A tactic being employed by the larger cargo ships transiting the area is to install a "panic room" which can be locked from the inside, and which is heavily protected (bullet proof door, etc.). This isn't really feasible on Kallisti, but it did get us thinking: is there some way we could hide and stay out of reach, long enough for the cavalry to arrive?

Somehow out of this brainstorming we had the idea of "hiding" underwater. Since both of us are now trained and licensed scuba divers, all we'd need to do is buy some gear and keep it ready to go on deck. If we see pirates coming we would hopefully have a minute or two before they reached the boat, enough time to snap off a quick mayday on the radio and jump in. Once we're down, we can pick a direction and swim for 20 or 30 minutes, getting a good separation from the pirates, who wouldn't know which way we went. Of course we'd have to bring a watertight container with a handheld radio, GPS and/or SPOT, and maybe some flares...

It's about this point in the conversation where I realize that we're seriously discussing the logistics of a plan to evade pirates by scuba diving off our boat in the open ocean. If there were ever a sign that your life has lost all semblance of sanity, that would be it. Nevertheless, I have to admit that with some planning and practice it could be a pretty good strategy.

Truth be told, I really don't know what to think right now. This week's attack definitely brought home the reality of the risks we're facing. I would be lying if I said that I wasn't scared, but what really gives me pause is the thought of what my friends and family would go through if something happened. On the other hand, as ted pointed out, there is a certain matter of principle at stake here. Declaring this to be a fight for freedom may be overly dramatic, but I do believe in not backing down from those who would seek to hurt you. I also believe in taking calculated risks to achieve big goals, something we've done several times this trip (see typhoons in Japan, or our 1000 mile trip to San Francisco as novice sailors). In the end there are many factors on both sides, and like so many things in life, it's a tough decision.

Fortunately we can procrastinate making that decision for a few more days. Once we get ashore we'll have some research and some soul-searching to do. Meanwhile I keep coming back to this thought: "Pirates? Really? It's 2011 and the biggest obstacle to sailing around the world is pirates?" Oh well, it's always something I guess.

		<description><![CDATA[We got into Sri Lanka on Sunday, and we've spent just about all our time since then trying to figure out what to do next. There are several other sailboats here that are in pretty much the same situation as us: reconsidering the wisdom of trying to sail to the Red Sea, and looking for other options. As far as we know nobody's found anything good.

The one option we've uncovered since the last time I wrote about this is the possibility of shipping the boat through to the Mediterranean. It turns out that there's a company which does this, and one of their boats is going through in just a few weeks, leaving from the Maldives and going to Turkey. In a way this would be great for us because instead of spending April beating against 25 knot headwinds up the Red Sea, we can be lying on beaches in the Aegean. The downside, and it's a major one, is the price tag: about $24,000. (For those keeping track, that's on the order of half the cost of our boat.)

Neither of us is excited about this choice. Aside from the massive cost, it also sort of feels like cheating. It's like running a marathon, and deciding 15 miles in that you're going to catch a bus over to mile 23. We set out to sail around the world, not to pay to have a boat shipped around for us. It probably sounds idealistic to put it in those terms, and maybe that's a fair criticism. But the fact of the matter is that there's a part of me that really wants to sail through, despite the risk, just to prove to myself that we can do it. That part believes that you can do anything with a little courage and determination, and the second we give up and ship the boat (or sell it here, or whatever) that little bit of me dies.

At the same time, I'm also a pragmatist, and in the end it boils down to a cost-benefit analysis. The risk of a pirate attack is an unknown, but last week's attack on the Quest seems to suggest it's higher than we'd thought before. And just this morning, I found out about another sailing yacht that was taken yesterday. Maybe the risk is still low overall, and maybe our scuba plan would have a pretty good chance of working, but there are too many unknowns to be confident. There are principles I care about enough to take such a risk for anyway, but this isn't one of them. If that little part of me has to die to let the rest live, so be it; I'll have plenty of opportunities to make it up to myself.

We still haven't decided anything for sure though. It's too big of a decision to make lightly, and we have a couple days before we have to set sail for Male to catch the transport ship. I would say that we'll spend that time enjoying Sri Lanka, but so far I have to admit I haven't been that impressed with the place. It's not the worst spot I've ever been though (that honor still goes to Anatahan) so we'll make the best of it.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

Given the events of the past couple weeks, we've decided (as have just about all the other sailboats in the region) that it's not worth trying to transit the Gulf of Aden right now. We've talked to several people here in Galle who met the crews of Quest and/or ING, both of which passed through not that long ago. I saw pictures of the three kids on board ING, now in pirate custody. Very sobering, though more than a little surreal. 

So we've been investigating other options, which have included: 

-Sailing around the Cape of Good Hope 
-Selling the boat here in Sri Lanka (or nearby in India or the Maldives) 
-Leaving the boat somewhere "until the pirate situation clears up"
-Shipping the boat through to the Mediterranean on a large transport (this service exists but is expensive) 
-Sailing back east to sell the boat somewhere with a better market: possibly Thailand or Singapore, but our current leaning would be Australia 

We're waiting to get confirmation from the transport company about availability of space on a vessel leaving the Maldives later this month. If it falls through a trip to Perth may be on the horizon. We should hear any minute now, but until then we're in limbo.

		<description><![CDATA[We finally heard back from the shipping company, and the logistics didn't work out. So Kallisti's around-the-world voyage is officially over, and her quest for a new owner begins. 

By a conspicuously fortuitous coincidence, an Australian guy looking to buy a second boat for his charter business in India dropped by our dock yesterday afternoon. We're in negotiations with him to see if our price ranges coincide. If that falls through, we'll be headed for Western Australia via Christmas Island (unless our plans change yet again). 

Kevin 

P.S. If anyone on this list is interested in buying a sailboat, now's the time to let us know - asking price is somewhere around US$60,000. Delivery service to "nearby" ports available on request :) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Christmas Island, that is. And I guess that unless we have perfect wind, it will probably be April by the time we get there. 

All of our various other options have failed to pan out, so we're headed to Australia to look for some buyers. The trip to Christmas Island is about 1800 nm, so it's a long one, but the conditions should be pretty good. And we'll finally get to cross the equator. According to the SPOT coverage map (http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=109) our updates should make it through fine, but we'll see. 

If anyone wants to try and visit us in mainland Australia, it's looking like we'll arrive in either Broome or Port Hedland in late April and spend May working our way down towards Perth. 

We'll set sail either tomorrow or Wednesday, depending on how the interminable battle against Sri Lankan bureaucracy is going this week. (Seriously, this place combines a Japanese-esque love of gratuitous process with tropical schedules and work ethic. Not going to miss it when we're gone.) 

Cheers,
Kevin ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The term "emotional rollercoaster" may be a little strong to describe the past two weeks, but it's definitely been a ride. For a while there, our plan of record seemed to be changing almost hourly. At one point, over a week ago, we had conclusively decided to sell the boat here in Sri Lanka, only to hear news that evening about a booming yacht market in Western Australia. In the interim, we got to experience the full emotional shock of the trip being Finished, Done, and Over. We'd even started cleaning up and looking at flights out of Sri Lanka to... whatever it is that we'd be doing next.

But then we backed off from that plan, and went back to waiting and looking for other options. For someone very goal-oriented like myself, a long stretch of goal-indecision and lack-of-plan is pretty exhausting. It's hard for me to concentrate on anything, because I'm too busy thinking about all the possibilities, and all the things I could be doing to get started on them if I only knew which one we were doing. Add to that the boiling heat during the days here, and the insatiable swarms of mosquitos at night (Ted must have killed at least a hundred or two), and you get a mediocre couple weeks.

So it was a tremendous relief for me when we finally heard back from the shipping company, and found out the logistics won't work out. One by one the options had dwindled down, and this news settled our course for us. The Mediterranean is, sadly, out of reach for Kallisti, and we'll have to finish our trip up in Australia instead. It'll take us a month or so to get to the northwest coast, via a stop in Christmas Island. Then we'll hop from town to down until we find a good place to put her up for sale, probably somewhere near Perth.

Since I sent word of our decision to the mailing list, I've gotten expressions of condolences from many friends and family members. These thoughts are really appreciated. To be sure, it's a disappointment not to be able to see our trip through as planned. It's especially frustrating to have the stumbling block be something as silly and pointless as pirates. Years from now, when we tell the story of how we "sailed half-way around the world," we'll always feel a pang of regret on that qualifier.

All that said, one of the main lessons I feel like I've taken away from this whole experience has been the following: you take what the wind gives you. In life, as in sailing, the vast majority of what happens to you is completely outside of your control. Rather than fighting against it, or railing against the gods or the seas for thwarting your plans, a sailor knows you just make the best of what you've got. And half the time, the wind will take you someplace better than where you'd been planning to go anyway.

In that spirit, I've started to get excited about our trip to Australia. Ever since I visited there for 10 days in 2005, I've been hoping to get back sooner or later. Now's my chance, and cruising the west coast in a sailboat is just about the best Australian vacation plan I can imagine. Not to mention Christmas Island, which has the looks of a tropical paradise on par with our favorites: Chichijima, Rota, or Pohnpei. Yes, it's disappointing to abandon the circumnavigation, but as defeats go I think this will turn out to be easy to swallow.

First thing's first though: we have 1820 nautical miles to cover between here and Christmas Island, landing it among our three longest passages ever. It should all be in pleasant tropical weather with (hopefully) favorable winds, but even in ideal conditions it's still at least two weeks at sea. Suffice it to say, we'll have more than enough time to reflect on recent events, and on things to come. It'll be good to be back on the water.
