(p "I'm going to level with you: I'm an engineer, not a scientist. It's just a fundamental fact of
   how my brain works. Why am I bringing this up now? Because so far this blog has been about
   memetics as a science, but that's not really my true passion. What attracts me to the field is
   the virtually limitless possibilities of applying memetic understanding to the real world. For
   today, I want to talk about the three main ways in which I envision memetics improving our lives:
   personal understanding, infrastructure optimization, and cultural engineering.")

(p "The first one is the least ambitious, but most immediately beneficial. When I say personal
   understanding, I mean the ability to conceptualize oneself as a brain whose beliefs are the
   product of a rich and ever-changing memetic environment. Naturally, this goes hand in hand with
   at least a rudimentary knowledge of neuroscience in general (e.g. I highly recommend Daniel
   Dennett's "
   (link "Consciousness Explained" "http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661")
   ").  For me, one of the main takeaways of these fields is that it's statistically almost certain
   that at least a few of my core beliefs are wrong. Recognizing that my brain is (extremely)
   fallible helps me treat my opinions as just data points, to be correlated with those of other
   brains in search of a good model of our shared world. It's also helpful to remember that other
   brains are similarly products of their own memetic environment, and therefore it's un- or
   counter-productive to blame their actions on their being \"selfish,\" \"evil,\" etc. The more
   people who can learn to treat each others&#8217; brains as shared computing resources, the better
   off we'll all be.")

(p "The prospects for memetically-inspired improvements to our communications infrastructure are
   extremely promising over the next decade or two. Just about all of human productivity these days
   boils down to the efficient discovery and propagation of good ideas, both big and small. Rarely,
   if ever, is this process done entirely within a single human brain; virtually all modern ideas
   are the product of a whole bunch of previously discovered memes colliding in just the right brain
   state, with a little luck, to generate a new mutation. Can we devise mechanisms that increase the
   likelihood/rate of finding  these happy accidents, and recognizing and spreading them once
   they've been found? These aren't easy problems but it's important to remember the scale we're
   talking about: a 1% improvement in the net productivity of human civilization is worth a
   <strong>lot</strong> of money. This is also an area ripe for a cooperative effort between human
   beings and our rapidly maturing artificially intelligent friends. The brain is still the best
   tool out there for creating and evaluating ideas, but computers far outstrip us in their ability
   to process massive amounts of data simultaneously. Using AI to track the movement of ideas
   amongst a community, and to choose which ideas are most likely to usefully stimulate which
   brains, we may be able to give \"natural\" memetic evolution a boost.")

(p "Finally, in the slightly more distant future, memetics may be the tool that gives us a serious
   shot at tackling some of human civilization's most fundamental problems. War, intolerance,
   corruption, and greed have been with us for so long that to most people the very suggestion of
   trying to eliminate them is hopeless idealism. Nevertheless, these things are ultimately just
   mechanical results of the aggregate brain states of the population. Seen from this perspective,
   \"utopia\" as such is merely an engineering challenge: how can we create cultural memes that
   discourage these behaviors, and that will be able to spread themselves to (near-)ubiquity? OK, so
   it's a monstrously difficult challenge, and it certainly is possible that genetics or \"human
   nature\" will eventually pose insurmountable obstacles to getting 100% of the way there. But
   again, any progress we can make down that road can have a very positive impact on the lives of
   billions of people. Of course, it's entirely possible that natural memetic evolution is already
   headed in this direction (there is certainly evidence to support such a claim), but speeding
   things along is still a worthwhile goal.")

(p "All of these applications are based on my own extremely minimal understanding of the science of
   memetics. As an engineer, my job is to take the stuff the scientists give me and figure out how
   to use it to change the world. So if you're into the science of memetics, I hope you'll take the
   time to donate your memes to me, and we'll see what we can do.")
