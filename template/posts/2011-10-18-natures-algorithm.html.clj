(p "Today's post is about a thought experiment that's been capturing my fancy a lot recently. In
   this experiment, we conceive of the entire Universe around us as nothing more (or less) than a
   massive simulation. We suppose that \"somewhere\" there's a computer whose memory banks model the
   precise state of every sub-atomic particle in the Cosmos. To make things simple let's assume that
   time and space are quantized, and more generally that the rules of physics are amenable to such a
   simulation.")

(p "Now imagine that we're outside observers, sitting in \"somewhere\" and watching this simulation
   run.  First of all, it's important to remember that what we're watching is just a bunch of
   patterns of bits flitting through the simulation's memory. As an illustration, suppose that each
   particle is tracked by a data structure containing its position, velocity, and other state.
   Looking at a snapshot of this data at a particular instant in time it would be very difficult to
   discern objects such as a table or a tree or a person. Such concepts are largely irrelevant, if
   not totally nonsensical, when viewed from the sub-atomic vantage point.")

(p "Which gets to the real value of the thought experiment. Our brains are evolved to identify and
   interact with \"objects\" at the scale that's relevant to our survival, so we tend to over-value
   distinctions at that scale. For example in trying to understand the biological world it's quite
   natural to think about individual animals as units of Darwinian evolution.  However when we get
   around to studying how ideas move through our society (i.e. memetics), our processing apparatus
   struggles because there are no readily available \"objects\" to form the basis of our model.")

(p "In light of this thought experiment, the line between biological and memetic evolution has
   blurred considerably in my mind. From the simulation's perspective, both are just different
   mechanisms by which patterns of data seem to be propagating themselves through time. Both rely on
   chaotic processes to explore enormous potential spaces of patterns, and utilize natural selection
   to gradually drive increasing sophistication. The details of how the patterns are persisted and
   copied are quite different when viewed from the human brain's default paradigm, but on a larger
   (or smaller?) scale the distinctions boil down to implementation details.")

(p "Instead of considering these to be distinct processes I now think of them as merely two
   manifestations of what I call Nature's Algorithm. It seems that, whether it's simulated or not,
   our Universe is built upon rules that irresistibly move towards increasingly complex
   self-replicating patterns. I strongly suspect that the particular implementations of evolution we
   happen to see are themselves accidents, part of a meta-evolutionary process by which nature
   discovers its own tools.  If this were indeed how Reality works, the implications would be
   profound; but even if it's utterly wrong, the thought experiment is a useful way to remind
   yourself of your brain's scale-based blind spots.")
