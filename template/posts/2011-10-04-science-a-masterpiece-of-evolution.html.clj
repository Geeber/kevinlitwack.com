(p "Many people have claimed, in my opinion justifiably, that evolution is one of the greatest
   results ever to come out of human science. Its ability to explain the complexity we see around us
   in terms of an accumulation of simple steps is breathtakingly elegant. But the subject of this
   post isn't how science discovered evolution; it's how evolution discovered science.")

(p "Hard as it is for us to imagine in modern times, for most of human history there really wasn't
   anything resembling the scientific method of understanding the world. Instead most people
   interpreted their environment via pre-scientific lenses, based on a mix of myths, legends,
   guesses, and rumors. We should resist the temptation to attribute this to some modern
   superiority, as genetically speaking there's hardly any difference between us and our ancestors
   of 2000 years ago.  Rather, the difference between us and them is in the progress that memetic
   evolution has made in the interim.")

(p "Like most everything bouncing around in our brains, the fundamental approach we take to building
   a model of the world is largely learned from our parents and peers. Memeplexes compete for this
   space, and over time those that do a better job at getting themselves copied will tend to
   dominate. One way that a memeplex can be successful is to be demonstrably better than its
   competitors at helping its host achieve his or her desired objectives, and memeplexes that yield
   better models of the world will tend to exploit this mechanism. And when it comes to good
   strategies for modeling your environment, science is hard to beat.")

(p "Whole volumes have been written about the various merits of science, so I won't go into details
   here. If you're reading this post, you're probably already pretty sold on that point anyway. What
   you may not have thought as much about is how complex and fiendishly clever the science memeplex
   really is. The idea that we should model the world by formulating hypotheses and then testing
   them in a repeatable manner is such a leap forward from \"we believe this because a book says
   so\" that it's little surprise science has proven such a formidable opponent for older and less
   agile worldview memeplexes.")

(p "The discovery of science also marks yet another case of evolution doing an excellent job of
   finding the sweet spots in a design space. There was an open niche for a memeplex that did a good
   job of modeling reality, and after a mere few thousand years we couldn't help but stumble onto
   it. Once the random mutations had fitted all the pieces together, the resulting thought process
   took off like wildfire. Instances like this give me great hope that there are even more powerful
   and transformative ideas out there, waiting for memetic evolution to stumble onto them - and
   equally great confidence that, in due time, it will.")
