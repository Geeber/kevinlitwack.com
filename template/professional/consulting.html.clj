(p "Update, 2014-06-30:")

(p "I'm very happy to announce that I accepted a full-time offer from Keen IO, so my consulting
   business is indefinitely postponed. I'll leave this page here for nostalgia's sake though ;)")

[:h2 "Philosophy"]

(p "I want to build awesome software to do cool stuff and make the world better. Freelancing allows
   me to experience a variety of problems, constantly learn new technologies, and connect with the
   pioneers of the bleeding edge. All of the most exciting stuff happens on the frontier.")

(p "As a freelancer, my reputation is my most valuable asset, so my goal is for every client I work
   with to feel like they got way more than they paid for. But even beyond the economic incentives,
   I believe deeply in the concept of \"pride in craftsmanship.\" If I'm not proud of what I'm
   building, then what's the point?")

(p "I have long adhered to a philosophy of \"monotonic improvement,\" meaning continually striving
   to get better at everything I do. Especially in today's world, if you're not learning then
   you're becoming obsolete. I encourage anyone I work with to tell me about any ways that I might
   be able to improve, whether technical or otherwise.")

[:h2 "Services"]

(p "For details on the services I can offer, see the sections below.")

[:h3 "End-to-end Project Development"]

(p "You have a project designed, and now you \"just need to write the code.\" I will work with you
   to make sure that all of the requirements are clearly defined, and then build a solution from
   scratch. I follow an iterative development process (something like Scrum, but modified based on
   experience) and will keep a high-bandwidth communication channel open. My priority is delivering
   a finished product that not only exceeds your expectations, but is also durable once I'm gone.
   This means high code quality with extensive comments and, if necessary, supporting architectural
   documentation.")

(p "Note: Aesthetic design is not my strong suit. If your project has visual components (such as a
   website or mobile app) then you should already have a design and/or a designer. Trust me, this
   is for your own good.")

[:h3 "Consulting"]

(p "If you already have existing code, I may still be able to help you. Here are some of the
   consulting services I can provide:")

[:ul
 [:li "Architecture review/planning"]
 [:li "Security review (including threat modeling, penetration testing, fuzzing, etc.)"]
 [:li "Performance troubleshooting"]
 [:li "Improving (or creating) automated test infrastructure"]
 [:li "Building management or compatibility tools"]
 [:li "Debugging (you only pay if/when I successfully root cause your issue)"]
 [:li "Updating, modernizing, porting, or just plain understanding old code"]]

(p "Depending on the specifics of your project, I may or may not be qualified to add enough value
   to justify my rate. My promise is that if you describe your needs, I will give you an honest
   opinion of whether or not I'm the right person for the job. As I explained above, client
   satisfaction is my highest priority, so I'd rather turn down a project than leave someone
   feeling like they wasted their money.")

[:h3 "Mentoring"]

(p "Do you or someone in your organization just need some help getting up to speed on a new
   technology or skill? If it's something I'm good at, I'm happy to teach as much as I can. This
   can also be included with end-to-end projects or consulting, to help transition my work to a new
   owner once I wrap up.")

[:h3 "Travel"]

(p "I'm based in Seattle and prefer to do most of my work from here, but arrangements can be made
   for site visits as appropriate.")

[:h2 "Technologies"]

(p "I am not a purist when it comes to technologies: use the tool that's right for your situation.
   That said, I naturally have more exposure to some technologies than others. The lists below are
   intended to give prospective clients a quick sense of my skill set, but are by no means
   exhaustive.  If you are curious about my experience with a particular technology (whether or not
   it's shown here), just ask!")

[:h3 "Tier 1"]

(p "Technologies which I have used extensively and can comfortably dive into on little notice:")

[:ul
 [:li "Java"]
 [:li "Android"]
 [:li "Ruby"]
 [:li "C/C++"]
 [:li "AWS (including S3, EC2, DynamoDB)"]]

(p "Note: I'm happy to operate in either Windows or Linux (including OS X) shops. I'll also work
   with whatever project/code management tools you prefer, or provide my own if necessary. I will
   be very happy if I can use Git :)")

[:h3 "Tier 2"]

(p "Technologies with which I have some experience (i.e., I can probably handle most
   non-expert-level work in these spaces, but I don't want to over-promise):")

[:ul
 [:li "Ruby on Rails"]
 [:li "Clojure"]
 [:li "JavaScript"]
 [:li "CSS/SCSS"]
 [:li "C#"]
 [:li "SQL"]
 [:li "Hadoop"]
 [:li "Machine Learning (in particular, interesting applications thereof)"]]

(p "Note: Projects involving these technologies may be eligible for a discounted rate, and/or may
   require some (non-billed) \"refresher\" study time before I start.")

[:h3 "Tier 3"]

(p "Technologies with which I am just familiar enough to know that I'd like to learn more:")

[:ul
 [:li "Go"]
 [:li "Python"]
 [:li "PHP (including Drupal, Joomla, or Wordpress)"]
 [:li "iOS"]
 [:li "Analytics and SEO"]
 [:li "Just about anything in the cloud performance space: Storm, Spark, Redis, Memcache, etc."]]

(p "Note: Projects involving these technologies are likely eligible for a significant discount, but
   will probably require at least a few weeks of (non-billed) study time before I start. I love
   deep-diving new technologies, and as always, I will not take on any project unless I'm confident
   that I can do it well (including following industry best practices and being aware of relevant
   trends).")

[:h2 "Social Impact"]

(p "While earning a livelihood is part of why I build software, I'm also passionate about
   leveraging my skills to make a difference in the world. If your project has a positive social
   impact, or is otherwise aligned with causes I care about, I may be able to offer a significant
   discount on my baseline hourly rate. Please contact me for details.")
